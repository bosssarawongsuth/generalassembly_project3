1,m5a5n3,The intro to the first book is utter perfection,"I love it so much. So many books will jump straight in with “there’s this preteen and he lives in a bad family ooOooO” but it actually sets up personality and a world outside or before magic. We don’t start with Harry, we start with the Dursley family. We see how there life is before, how they avoid strange things and people, how Vernon blatantly ignores what he sees in favor of a “normal” thought or sight. 

I think it really makes the Dursley’s seem more like people, the non magical world more human. And then when the wizards drop off Harry on Pivot Drive we get a taste of the plot, still without a protagonist. I don’t know, I just think the story building is wonderful. It’s not particularly difficult to think of something like this to put as a prologue but it’s so rarely done and so well.

7,m4pcku,Albus Dumbledore is not guilty but just a common man who makes mistakes,"I have seen a lot of people bash Albus like anyhting just because he used Severus (kind of) and let Harry die. But I think different. Dude is literally one of the finest characters of the whole series and has a whole lot more good than bad. Him leaving Harry with Vernon and Petunia is a genius idea. Not because Harry was abused in that house like anything, but because it protected Harry. You see, Frank and Alicia were tortured by the Death Eaters still on the move. If any wizard family kept Harry with them, what was the guarantee the Death Eaters would not come knocking on their doors? He was far safe with Vernon and Petunia. And again, if Harry knew about his fame from the beginning, he would not have been as modest and selfless as we see him now. Then coming to his fifth year, yes Albus made a big mistake ignoring Harry and forcing him to take lessons with Severus, but he himself admit it, and making mistakes is natural, although it did cost Harry too much, you can not ignore that Albus still had Harry's best interest at heart and he tried to make the correct decision, in which he obviously failed, he was not intentionally making Harry suffer throughout the School year. Last coming to him raising Harry as a Pig for slaughter, I honestly believe that Albus did forsee that Harry can make it through when the Horocrux inside him was destroyed, after all, he did have a fantastic larger plan. And he really loved Harry and his family, remember when he was saying ""do not kill them, kill me"" in the Half Blood Prince? Harry himself acknowledges that. And Albus' portrait was in tears when Harry met him after the battle of Hogwarts. And during the Half Blood Prince, Albus was determined to find out as much as he could about the Horocruxes until his last breath to repay Harry for the previous year's mistakes. All in all, Albus did make some mistakes, but he had Harry's and the magical world's best interests at heart and he tried as much as he could to keep them all safe after he was gone. Oh, and he devised the plan which ultimately caused the downfall of Lord Voldemort.

8,m5dgol,How the films ruined Draco Malfoy,"When people ask you which Harry Potter character was ruined by the films, answers are most likely either Ginny or Ron. Some people mention Snape. Some people consider Hermione. I agree with all of them. The movies indeed destroyed Ron and Ginny and over-glorified Hermione and Snape.

However, no one talks about Draco Malfoy.   
The boy who had no choice. The boy who was abused. The boy who should have ended up with the chosen one or the brightest witch of her age. Aww... Let me play the tiniest violin in the world.

The films rewrote Draco Malfoy. They left out 90% of his malicious moments:

1. He met Harry at Madam Malkin's Robe Shop in the Philosopher's Stone. And on his 1st meeting, he insulted Harry's parents, Hagrid, and muggle-borns.
2. Then he invited Harry and Ron on a midnight duel but never showed up because he wanted them to get expelled.
3. He used a leg locker curse on Neville.
4. He wished death upon Hermione three times in the Chamber of Secrets.
5. He fat-shamed Molly Weasley.
6. He laughed at the prospect of Hermione’s sexual harassment in the Goblet of Fire.
7. He mocked Hermione for having large front teeth.
8. He called Harry's mother a mudblood.
9. He laughed at Cedric's death.
10. He made potter stink badges to humiliate Harry.
11. He wrote an entire song to bully Ron.
12. And then in the 6th book he was gloating about his dark mark to his friends.
13. He refused Snape's help just because he wanted the glory all by himself.
14. He tried to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED.
15. He chose the wrong path EVERY TIME. And his last major act was trying to capture the trio in the Room of Requirement. And after Harry saved his life, he tried to convince a Death Eater that he was on their side.

And guess what? The films left out ALL OF THESE. They portrayed him as a bratty cool kid rather than the complete idiot he is in the books. They had him smiling at his arch-nemesis while bullying him. They made him way more sympathetic than he was in the books. As a result, horny fangirls try to shove garbage like Drarry and Dramione down everyone's throat.

11,m55hem,Unpopular Opinion: Dumbledore did not raise Harry like a pig for slaughter.,"(Obligatory I'm on mobile, sorry for errors)

First off, starting with the prophecy it says ""neither can live while the other survives"" meaning between the two people one of them will die and one of them will live, obviously. Dumbledore says clearly to Harry he's doing everything he can to make sure Harry is the one who survives. 

The next part of the prophecy is that Harry will have a power of the dark Lord knows not. Dumbledore instantly recognizes this as the power of love. Even when Voldemort was a kid Dumbledore recognized that Voldemort didn't know what it meant to be a friend and he didn't know what it meant to care about others and therefore he didn't understand or value love. So after Harry survived when he was a baby, what does Dumbledore do? He sends Harry to his family. At this point I don't think he knew they would abuse Harry (cause let's be fair, all Dumbldore knew about Petunia was that she's muggle who envied her magical sister, wanting so badly to be a witch herself, perhaps she would then respect or value the magical world? Turns out she didn't, but to be fair again, all Dumbledore had to go on we're letters written 10+ years ago and he *did* plead to her to treat Harry as her own son). Dumbledore only really knew that the blood connecting Harry to his mother and to his aunt would act as protection because that blood represented the sacrifice that Lily made to keep Harry alive, and therefore the blood sacrifice that would protect Harry from Voldemort, again because Voldemort doesn't understand the concept of sacrificing yourself solely because you love someone. Turns out the Dursleys did abuse Harry, but despite this he gained a deep appreciation for family and frieds because he didn't have either as a child.

Because Harry understood the importance of having a family, I think it drew him closer to Ron and Hermione and then later to Sirius- which is important. Even after Sirius's death when Harry's throwing things around Dumbledore's office screaming about how much it hurts Dumbledore points out to him that this pain he's feeling is his greatest strength. Why? Because Harry wanted to die rather than allow Sirius to die, which means he understood the importance of self-sacrifice in the effort to save the ones you love, a feeling that Voldemort would never and could never understand because all Voldemort cared about was power and self-preservation. 

Later when Harry understands the fullness of the prophecy and he feels the immense burden and responsibility to go and find Voldemort to kill him, Dumbledore instantly tells him he needs to go tell Ron and Hermione, they need to be with him and that even though this is very important information that needs to remain secret, Dumbldore recognized that Harry needed support from those he loves because needed companions, something that Voldemort never had (again, going back to loving others). 

But then Dumbledore also tells Harry out right, he can walk away from this, he doesn't have to have the prophecy apply to him because at the end of the day they're just words. The only reason the prophecy is affecting people is because they're acting like it's fact. But when Dumbldore asks Harry to imagine his life if he went forward without knowing about the prophecy, what would Harry naturally want to do? Harry says outright, he'd want to kill Voldemort to prevent more people from dying because Voldemort took away those he loved. That stopping Voldemort is a cause worth dying for.  Harry recognizes right then and there that it's not like he's being forced to face Voldemort but he's *choosing* to face him. All the work that Dumbledore's doing is to best ensure that Harry survives by telling Harry about the horcruxes and telling Harry how to destroy the horcruxes so that when Harry faces Voldemort, Voldemort would be just a normal mortal man though still a powerful wizard. 

I also think Dumbledore recognized the connection Harry and Voldemort shared, that Harry had accidentally become a horcrux when he was a baby and survived the curse because Voldemort's sole was so severely shattered at the point. This told Dumbledore that Harry would have to die, however when he died it would be Voldemort's soul being killed not Harry's, because again Harry's was protected by the power of love, both the love that his family had for him and also the love that he has for those around him, whereas Voldemort's soul had no protection. (And if you want to argue that there's no way Dumbledore could know this, we need to remember that about 80% of the plan to kill Voldemort was speculation. Dumbledore says himself that he's mostly guessing but typically his guesses are correct).

So at the end of all, I don't think Dumbledore was preparing Harry for death, I think he knew it would be an incredibly difficult journey, but because of his theories about the power of love and about Harry being a horcrux I think  Dumbledore had a pretty good certainty that Harry would be able to survive it all because, again, he was able to feel that self sacrificial love for those around him, and be was protected by the same love from others (like, come on, at the battle of Hogwarts everyone was basically ""it's ok if I die Harry, just try to stop Voldemort"").

12,m5emn4,Why Tom Riddle Snr. was the most misunderstood character,"Tom Riddle Senior was a snobby, rude young man with snobby, rude parents. He was either dating or engaged to a young woman, Cecilia, and they would often ride past the Gaunt cottage in Little Hangleton, much to the chagrin of Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt.

When Morfin and Marvolo went to Azkaban following an attack on a muggle, Merope was left by herself. She was in love with Tom and brewed a love potion, so when he rode past the cottage on a hot day, she tricked him into drinking the potion. He, of course, fell instantly “in love” with her.

Tom and Merope married and a few months later, Merope fell pregnant with Voldemort. It was at this point that she believed that Tom loved her genuinely, so she stopped giving him the potion. This was not the case, and Tom left without another word, returning to his parents’ manor and remaining there until his death in 1943.

There are people who are like “Tom was such an asshole, he should have stayed with his wife and kid!” and “No wonder Voldemort turned out evil!”. But, coming from someone who believes fathers should be in their children’s lives - Tom had *every right to leave.*

He was raped for months, coerced into marriage, and all this without his consent (as he wasn’t in his right frame of mind). Merope was in the wrong, not Tom, and it calls on the importance of the consequences of date rape drugs (love potions).",2021-03-15 06:39:13,0,discussion,8,0.9,0,0,8,0,6,0,1,0,Mon,0,1,"Why Tom Riddle Snr. was the most misunderstood character Tom Riddle Senior was a snobby, rude young man with snobby, rude parents.

13,m5f09z,Why Grindelwald is a better villain than Voldemort,"Even though Voldemort is much ahead of Grindelwald in terms of magical prowess and evilness, Grindelwald is still scarier.

**Voldemort** made his agenda quite clear. He wanted to clean the wizarding community from any muggle-borns. He wanted an endless supply of power and establish his pureblood mania.

**Grindelwald** was more shrewd. His agenda was to free the wizarding community and abolish the statue of secrecy. Why should the magical folk live in secret? The scary part is not his power, but his manipulative tendencies, his ability to convince the people to join his side for the greater good.

**With Voldemort, the line between good and bad was clear. The same lines got blurred with Grindelwald.**

He brainwashed his followers and they supported him of their own free will. They were fully loyal and dedicated to his cause.

On the contrary, most of the Death eaters followed Voldemort out of fear. Only a handful (like Bellatrix) were truly loyal.

**Voldemort was a leglimens,** but you could always use Occlumency to counter his mind-reading.  
On the other hand, **Grindelwald was a seer**. How does one combat this particular power?

**Voldemort** made his agenda quite clear. He wanted to clean the wizarding community from any muggle-borns. He wanted an endless supply of power and establish his pureblood mania.

**Grindelwald** was more shrewd. His agenda was to free the wizarding community and abolish the statue of secrecy. Why should the magical folk live in secret? The scary part is not his power, but his manipulative tendencies, his ability to convince the people to join his side for the greater good.

**With Voldemort, the line between good and bad was clear. The same lines got blurred with Grindelwald.**

He brainwashed his followers and they supported him of their own free will. They were fully loyal and dedicated to his cause.

On the contrary, most of the Death eaters followed Voldemort out of fear. Only a handful (like Bellatrix) were truly loyal.

**Voldemort was a leglimens,** but you could always use Occlumency to counter his mind-reading.  
On the other hand, **Grindelwald was a seer**. How does one combat this particular power?

14,m59qfe,"I’m in Hufflepuff, but I denied it at first","I binged all eight movies last month during a school holiday. I’d watched some of them sporadically in my childhood, but never really got into Harry Potter (books or movies) much. 

Fast forward to now and, in short, I’m obsessed. I got super sad once I finished the movies for the first time so I watched them all again, but that didn’t fill the void.

27,m5ehjx,"Unpopular Opinion, I didn't like the way Harry got the Elder Wand's loyalty.","Now, don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the Harry Potter series and of the fact that wands change loyalty, but I always thought how Harry gained possession was lazy. I never liked the convoluted ""Draco had possession of the wand because he disarmed Dumbledore, and then I took Draco's other wand in a completely separate incident, so it belongs to me now"" path of the wand. 

Does this mean that when you disarm someone, even in training, their wand no longer has any allegiance to them? If so, does anyone in Dumbledore's army even still own their own wand? Do the wizards have to use it for a while to form a bond with it? Draco never even touched the Elder Wand, so why would it choose him? Also, why would both of Draco's wands change allegiance if Harry stole only one of them?

28,m50vou,I would have been super creeped-out having Mad-Eye Moody as a teacher,"(Yes, of course the REAL Mad-Eye was never actually a teacher, but my point stands regardless. Also, disclaimer: I'm a girl)

During the Yule Ball, ""Moody"" compliments Harry on his socks, which he'd received from Dobby. But Moody couldn't see those socks through conventional methods; he saw them using his magical false eye. Immediately after this, Parvati said she thought Moody and his eye were ""so creepy,"" which Harry pretty much dismissed because he liked Moody. When I first read this as a teenager, I didn't think much of it.

But now? Of COURSE any teenage girl would be weirded out by Moody's magical eye! It can clearly see through clothing, so girls like Parvati would know that Moody was completely capable of seeing their underwear...or perhaps underneath. We're never truly certain how Moody's eye works - does he have to put forth effort to see certain things (like socks under robes), or does he just see these things automatically? Regardless, this would be seriously creepy.

If he were my teacher, I would be wondering if he was keeping his eye to himself, so to speak. So many older men creep on teenage girls - almost every girl I know has dealt with a male teacher or coach that gave them the creeps (myself included). I would lump Moody into the same category. His actual intent would be irrelevant in my eyes; the mere fact that he was capable of essentially undressing me with his eye would be enough to make me very uncomfortable in his presence. I would think ""he looked at Harry's socks under his robes and then *commented on them* to Harry; what is he looking at on me?!""

Now, do I think that the *real* Alastor Moody would do anything sexually inappropriate? No, I do not.

30,m5g0w3,Finished my first re-read of the series in years.,"So I grew up with the books (first one came out when I was 11, same as Harry), and I re-read each one several times throughout the years, but I finally put my nose to the books again and re-read the entire series from beginning to the end for the first time in around 10 years.

Firstly, I forgot just how well-written everything was. I fell in love with each character again. When I read the part where Harry got to King's Cross for the first time, not knowing where to go, I totally teared up. I love how he just casually approached the Weasley family, not knowing that they'd basically adopt him as one of their own from then on. And I love how Molly helped him out probably knowing exactly who he was the whole time but not saying anything about it. And then just how casually everyone in the family (save Ginny of course) treated him.

I also love all the foreshadowing and clues that Rowling left in the books, and especially how she made them seem so mundane at the time, like ""oh and they found a locket that they couldn't open so they chucked it somewhere,"" or ""Harry found some kind of tiara and put it on a mannequin because why not?""

I also realized just how much I forgot. There were a lot of little events in the books that were left out of the films, like Nick's deathday party and such. I get that they weren't really that important but they really fleshed out this world that Rowling created. Then of course there were all the big things they left out that I wish they didn't, like all the Voldemort flashbacks in book 6 and a complete re-tooling of the entire plot of book 4. I know that with the films they're pressed for time so they can't talk about every single little event in the books (especially considering the word count of books 4 and 5) so I don't fault the directors for doing what they did, but it was still missed. I remember doing a watch of all 8 films with my friend who hadn't read the books and having to explain a lot because the films didn't bother to (like who the Marauders really were and where the map came from, for example). I still like the films though, but I see their faults.

I also love the complete changes in mood as the books go along. It's very gradual from the first to the sixth, getting darker and more mature as it goes along, but book 7 almost feels like it's part of an entirely different book series considering just how dark it got. I love that though so don't think I'm bashing it. I thought the final book was incredible, and I loved the bits about the trio on the run and listening to the Potterwatch radio program.

I will say this though, and it's probably an unpopular opinion. I thought that for the most part, Ginny wasn't the best character until the fifth book. Of course after that she really got good, but the whole ""doesn't talk, constantly smitten with Harry"" thing got kinda old. I'm glad Rowling gave her some depth starting with book 5. That said, I think Harry's feelings for her came kinda quickly.

Finally, I love the epilogue. I'm so glad they were able to give the next generation names and personalities in such a short number of pages. I never read Cursed Child and don't intend to, but I did read the fanfic sequel series by George Norman Lippert and I don't think he would have been able to make them as good as they were without this tiny part of the last book.

All in all, a great re-read. Definitely more emotional than I remember too, I found myself crying in a lot of parts, from the heartwarming stuff to the depressing. My kids are still way too young for these but I can't wait to get the chance to read it with them and see how they react to it. My son is old enough to be aware of what it is and he already enjoys parts of the movies and watching me play the Lego games so hopefully he'll enjoy it once I read them with him.",2021-03-15 08:23:06,1,discussion,2,1.0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,Mon,0,1,"Finished my first re-read of the series in years. So I grew up with the books (first one came out when I was 11, same as Harry), and I re-read each one several times throughout the years, but I finally put my nose to the books again and re-read the entire series from beginning to the end for the first time in around 10 years.

Firstly, I forgot just how well-written everything was. I fell in love with each character again. When I read the part where Harry got to King's Cross for the first time, not knowing where to go, I totally teared up. I love how he just casually approached the Weasley family, not knowing that they'd basically adopt him as one of their own from then on. And I love how Molly helped him out probably knowing exactly who he was the whole time but not saying anything about it. And then just how casually everyone in the family (save Ginny of course) treated him.

I also love all the foreshadowing and clues that Rowling left in the books, and especially how she made them seem so mundane at the time, like ""oh and they found a locket that they couldn't open so they chucked it somewhere,"" or ""Harry found some kind of tiara and put it on a mannequin because why not?""

I also realized just how much I forgot. There were a lot of little events in the books that were left out of the films, like Nick's deathday party and such. I get that they weren't really that important but they really fleshed out this world that Rowling created. Then of course there were all the big things they left out that I wish they didn't, like all the Voldemort flashbacks in book 6 and a complete re-tooling of the entire plot of book 4. I know that with the films they're pressed for time so they can't talk about every single little event in the books (especially considering the word count of books 4 and 5) so I don't fault the directors for doing what they did, but it was still missed. I remember doing a watch of all 8 films with my friend who hadn't read the books and having to explain a lot because the films didn't bother to (like who the Marauders really were and where the map came from, for example). I still like the films though, but I see their faults.

I also love the complete changes in mood as the books go along. It's very gradual from the first to the sixth, getting darker and more mature as it goes along, but book 7 almost feels like it's part of an entirely different book series considering just how dark it got. I love that though so don't think I'm bashing it. I thought the final book was incredible, and I loved the bits about the trio on the run and listening to the Potterwatch radio program.

I will say this though, and it's probably an unpopular opinion. I thought that for the most part, Ginny wasn't the best character until the fifth book. Of course after that she really got good, but the whole ""doesn't talk, constantly smitten with Harry"" thing got kinda old. I'm glad Rowling gave her some depth starting with book 5. That said, I think Harry's feelings for her came kinda quickly.

Finally, I love the epilogue. I'm so glad they were able to give the next generation names and personalities in such a short number of pages. I never read Cursed Child and don't intend to, but I did read the fanfic sequel series by George Norman Lippert and I don't think he would have been able to make them as good as they were without this tiny part of the last book.

All in all, a great re-read. Definitely more emotional than I remember too, I found myself crying in a lot of parts, from the heartwarming stuff to the depressing. My kids are still way too young for these but I can't wait to get the chance to read it with them and see how they react to it.

34,m5cm67,Was Sirius Black living through eternal grief?,"I had this thought as I got started on the ootp again for my yearly HP read. As we all know, Sirius was in Azkaban for a very long time, and was able to get away from being totally dissolved into nothing but his worst fears because of his illegal animagus status. But there is no way he could have totally been unscathed. As a person out of Azkaban... Sirius was so fatally flawed by his inability to see past his emotions. He had no high road, he was cruel and irrational, completely driven by his emotions that were always so fierce whether they be positive or negative. I know some of these are him as a person, but others just seem so extreme. Now when I look at how he acts I think back to when I lost my best friend. She died when I was a teenager and Sirius, as a whole feels like the embodiment of all the emotions I felt throughout the first year or so of grieving. If those emotions were to stand on their own as a person I think they would act similarly to Sirius (if that makes sense) it wasn’t that I couldn’t be spoken or I was nonsensical or lost me and who I was, but everything inside of me was so unhinged, scattered and irrational. I don’t think I had a response to anything that wasn’t driven by my emotions for months, and I constantly found myself thinking of the past, holding on to painful memories in order to feel closeness while also holding onto those around me even tighter for fear of losing more. I know that Dumbledore had logistical reasons for keeping Sirius hidden, but if looking at that, plus how Snape toys with him (and is able to get him so worked up) and how Molly feels the need to tell him that Harry is not James.. it leads me to wonder if maybe Sirius was more effected by the dementors then I had originally seen. If dementors take away enough happy memories that the only ones left are the few had with your best friend (who died) , and taking those away also causes those feelings of grief to feel so fresh (your worst memories)... I think that there is a good chance that Sirius was living in a constant state of the early stages of grief that he couldn’t move past because he was unable to create new memories while in prison and there wasn’t anything else left to him by the time he escaped. When he says “nice one James” to Harry, maybe it’s not a slip of the tongue, but more of him still being so far entangled in his eternal grief he isn’t seeing Harry. It would also account for his totally irrational and immature behaviour (going to the train station, giving Harry the cold shoulder because he doesn’t want him to visit, being so cruel to Kreacher saying he is going to throw away everything he wants to keep), these things really stand out as things that could be done by a person who isn’t in their right mind and trying to handle grief, especially if you consider all the negative feelings of his family, abandonment, etc. are all he has besides his grief now post prison as well.

However, I don’t much like the adjectives and/or descriptions of the Dursley family, nor any other character we are being influenced against (Snape, Umbridge, etc.). I really hate Umbridge so I hated writing that parenthetical. 

Anyway, most of the novels, particularly the first few, are filled with rude descriptions of Vernon/Dudley as obese, neckless, etc. (the size of a young killer whale, bottom drooping over the sides of his chair are two that come to mind). Petunia is described as horsey, with a long neck, etc. 

Why is it so horrible to allow their heinous actions to speak for the Dursleys, as opposed to inducing vitriol for them by means of insulting their physical appearances. 

To me, it’s totally justified for JKR to cast the Dursleys in a negative light because they’re bullies who neglect and abuse Harry, or because of their general rudeness and other obnoxious tendencies. She doesn’t have to induce our hatred for them by calling them fat or horse-faced. That lessens my dislike of them.

39,m5eiui,The most favourite and least favourite characters in Harry Potter (according to houses)," 

**\[GRYFFINDOR\]**

&gt;Favourite: Harry Potter.

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, Fred/George Weasley, Remus Lupin. }*

Harry, the guy himself. Personally, I feel Harry’s pretty admirable and very relatable. He looks on the bright side of situations, and he’s a lot more optimistic than people make him out to be, despite losing a lot of people he loved over the years. He’s a mentally strong character, loyal and warm-hearted.

A little irrational sometimes, and definitely has anger issues, but that’s what makes him human, I guess.

But seriously, his sarcasm’s *on point.*

\_\_ \_\_ \_\_ \_\_

&gt;Least Favourite: Peter Pettigrew

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Percy Weasley }*

He was a complete coward and was a terrible friend. Counting the fact he did it all to just save himself. Overall, just a terrible person.

**\[HUFFLEPUFF\]**

&gt;Favourite: Cedric Diggory.

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Nymphadora Tonks. }*

In short, Cedric’s an angel in human form. He helped out Harry a lot during the Tri-Wizard Tournament and was in general, a kind, caring person.

\_\_ \_\_ \_\_ \_\_

&gt;Least Favourite: Zacharias Smith.

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Ernie Macmillan. }*

Just, no. When I was reading the Order of Phoenix, I had the biggest urge to go through the pages and stab this guy in the eye with a wand. He honestly just pissed me off.

**\[RAVENCLAW\]**

&gt;Favourite: Luna Lovegood.

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Filius Flitwick, Garrick Ollivander }*

Luna’s a truly wondrous character. She’s clever but in a more magical, marvellous way. She’s a pure, good-natured character, and although eccentric sometimes, has a lot of personalities to offer. What’s not to like?

\_\_ \_\_ \_\_ \_\_

&gt;Least Favourite: Sybill Trelawney.

{ *Honourable mentions/others = Gilderoy Lockhart, Marietta Edgecombe. }*

There isn’t a clear, definite reason why I don’t like Trelawney, but she felt a little too strange and over-the-top sometimes. I felt pretty sorry for her sometimes since the students had a knack for making fun of her, but she overall felt too forceful with her fore-seeing and predictions, even though they were right sometimes.

**\[SLYTHERIN\]**

&gt;Favourite: Draco Malfoy.

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Bellatrix Lestrange, Severus Snape, Narcissa Malfoy }*

Now, before anyone says ‘yOu OnLy LiKe DrACo MaLfOy BeCAuSe YoU ThInK ToM FeLTon’s HoT!!’ let me tell you that you’re wrong.

Although I never agreed with Malfoy’s bullying motives and his harsh actions, his arrogance did make me laugh a lot.

Just like Harry, I think he is quite relatable (personally).

\_\_ \_\_ \_\_ \_\_

&gt;Least Favourite: Tom Riddle/Voldemort.

*{ Honourable mentions/others = Dolores Umbridge }*

Most people put Umbridge into this category, and I definitely hate her for sure, but there’s something about Tom himself that really makes me want to bang my head against a wall.

The reason for Tom being my least favourite isn’t because he’s well, the villain in the story. It’s actually because he has a knack for making everything so goddamn complicated.

It’s always like: *‘Oh Harry, I’ve got you trapped, but let’s give you a 10-minute lecture before I kill you because it’s an unfortunate habit I have.’*

Why even use an ‘Avada Kedavra’ on a baby at the start? You think a baby’s going to fight back? He could’ve just yeeted Harry out of the window, but sure, use up your energy casting a spell for no reason-

43,m5e6zd,This fan theory will blow your mind,"This one fan theory is really cool. Every one of us would want The Boy Who Lived to live on forever, right?

In the books, it implies that, in the end, one of them (Voldemort and Harry) will have to kill each other. What if it meant something else instead?

What if it meant that the *only way* either of them could die would be at the hand of the other?

&gt;either must die at the hand of the other...

Meaning the one who didn't die had no means of achieving death. Meaning that the only way Harry can die is at the hand of Voldemort. But now that Voldemort is dead, HARRY CAN'T DIE.

In the books, it implies that, in the end, one of them (Voldemort and Harry) will have to kill each other. What if it meant something else instead?

What if it meant that the *only way* either of them could die would be at the hand of the other?

&gt;either must die at the hand of the other...

Meaning the one who didn't die had no means of achieving death. Meaning that the only way Harry can die is at the hand of Voldemort. But now that Voldemort is dead, HARRY CAN'T DIE.

45,m5e01u,Emma Watson's amazing glow up in the POA,"Many people wonder how Emma Watson got such an amazing glow-up from *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* to *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*.

When *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone* was released, Emma was 11, it was 2001. A year later, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was released. They took a while to make the third film because Daniel Radcliffe’s parents wanted him to focus on his education more. So, after 2 years, when Emma Watson was 14, the third film premiered. 

Remember how in the first two films, Hermione had bushy hair, but then in the third film, she started to have less?  And they stopped wearing the Hogwarts robes often? 

The robes were very itchy and Emma persuaded the new director to wear jeans. She also disliked the bushy hair extensions. So, she stopped wearing them in the third film.

The air begins to feel a little thin

As I start the car, and then I begin

To add the miles piled up behind me

I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south

I want to crack the door so I can just fall out

But then I remember when you packed my car

You reached in the back and buckled up your heart

For me to drive away with

I began to understand why God died

The demons sat there waiting on her porch

It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch

And when my car was far out of sight

He crept in her room and stayed there for the 
night

And then I felt chills in my bones

The breath I saw was not my own

I knew my skin that wrapped my frame

Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand

He laid it out, what he had planned

And then I said I'll take the grave

93,m50gbr,What if Neville was the BWL/if Harry died in GOF,"I see a lot of fics and some posts about what if Neville was the boy who lived,most of these have Neville follow the same events that Harry and the trio did just with Ginny and Luna. I also see what if Harry had died in GOF. In half of these,it’s just Neville taking over doing all the things that Harry and the trio did,just Ginny and Luna are the trio. However imo this wouldn’t be accurate.

If Voldemort had gone after Neville, there are certain factors we would have to think about: Was it his mum or dad who would protect him, would he still live with his grandma? Would he grow up away from all the fame like Harry?

If it was his dad who did it, he most likely would grow up with his grandma,which I think would leave with worse with his fears cause of the pressure. He would grow up hearing how he was the boy who lived, he would defeat Voldemort. Maybe even have dumbledore visit him. 

His friends wouldn’t be Ginny and Luna , he only met them through the DA , which isn’t until 5th year. I don’t think hermione would ever become his close friend,as she just wouldn’t have the patience in her first year(not hermione/Neville  bashing) I’m not saying Neville is an idiot ,hermione just wouldnt have time for his insecurities,something that she got a lot better at overtime, I still think Ron would become friends with Harry, they just have so chemistry, I also think hermione would be the same if they manage to become friends,which the hard part. Anyway, how does Neville do all these things on his own? Easy answer: he can’t AT THIS STAGE.

The thing that set Harry apart is that after all those years he still had the courage, he had the courage to go battle a troll, to go get the stone (I also think he would of been much much much more insecure and wouldn’t done have the things he did with out Ron and hermione but anyway) Neville needed support and that’s totally okay, he wouldn’t have been ready like many 11 year olds. Neville could have done all this maybe in this 3rd year? I don’t really know? The DA really helped him cause he was getting positive  support from harry.

Harry would have grown up loved,with the mum and dad and Sirius and Remus,I think he still would of gone to gryfinndor to please his parents more than avoiding slytherin, he would be more confident and know he has a family, he wouldn’t be as close to the Weasleys, however I see Ron becoming close the potters, to not feel insecure at his home cause he wasn’t special enough. Hermione would form a bond with lily since there both muggleborn, are smart etc

I don’t think lily and snape would of reconciled they were just to far gone and Harry would of taken the brunt of it but never told his mum in fear of there being a fight.

If Harry had died in GOF, that’s it. Neville can’t be a backup cause the prophecy. Harry died and Voldemort won. He hasn’t marked Neville as his equal so he just wins",2021-03-14 18:10:42,0,question,1,0.67,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,Sun,6,1,"What if Neville was the BWL/if Harry died in GOF I see a lot of fics and some posts about what if Neville was the boy who lived,most of these have Neville follow the same events that Harry and the trio did just with Ginny and Luna. I also see what if Harry had died in GOF. In half of these,it’s just Neville taking over doing all the things that Harry and the trio did,just Ginny and Luna are the trio. However imo this wouldn’t be accurate.

If Voldemort had gone after Neville, there are certain factors we would have to think about: Was it his mum or dad who would protect him, would he still live with his grandma? Would he grow up away from all the fame like Harry?

If it was his dad who did it, he most likely would grow up with his grandma,which I think would leave with worse with his fears cause of the pressure. He would grow up hearing how he was the boy who lived, he would defeat Voldemort. Maybe even have dumbledore visit him. 

His friends wouldn’t be Ginny and Luna , he only met them through the DA , which isn’t until 5th year.

99,m4hbl0,why all the films are amazing,"So, we always see critiques of the films about some book moments that aren't included, or the infamous ""Dumbledore said, **calmly**"", but I don't really see a lot of appreciation, so thought I'd just go through why all the films are just awesome, and why I can't pick a worst or best.

Philosophers Stone - introduction to the series, so much warmth, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and the Great Hall, and it is just such a heart warming film to watch and was done so well.

Chamber of Secrets - once again, just so warm and it was great to see the Burrow, the scene with the Cornish pixies was amazing, as was the acromantula scene and polyjuice potion scene, and the basilisk scene was so entertaining to watch, and Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Lockhart was just awesome.

Prisoner of Azkaban - cinematography = AMAZING, I loved all those exterior shots, and I loved seeing the Hogwarts students in normal muggle clothes, and the whole shrieking shack scene has had me glued to the screen every time I watch the movie.

Goblet of Fire - really cool to see all the teenager stuff Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through like dating, and the scene with Voldemort returning and Cedric's death was done SO well, I could feel Harry's shock and fear just radiating through the screen.

Order of the Phoenix - I've seen a lot of people say this is the worst movie, but I can't see why. Imelda Staunton played Umbridge brilliantly, and the scene with Fred and George and the fireworks was so fun to watch. Daniel portrays Harry's difficulty over dealing with what happened last year really well, and Harry's anger is of course understandable, the poor guy has really had a traumatic life, and of course, we know he's only going to go through more trauma. The battle at the Ministry was just... I have no words. It was amazing, and of course Sirius's death was heartbreaking, and the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was just... WOAH.

Half-Blood Prince - once again, really entertaining to see the average teenager sides of the Golden Trio, and the scene with the fire at the Burrow was so entertaining, and Dumbledore's death scene was so dramatic and dark and just done so well (I am aware that I am repeating ""so well"" a lot, it has become clear to me through writing this post that my vocabulary is a lot more limited than I thought), and Tom Felton portrayed Draco's fear really well as well, and Bellatrix in the Great Hall was done amazingly.

Deathly Hallows Part 1 - the 7 Harry's scene was so entertaining to watch, the wedding was fun, then seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione trying to hunt down the Horcruxes and facing obstacles was really entertaining, and with the whole fight scene between Ron and Harry, Emma, Dan, and Rupert all did that really well. Just want to say, about the dance between Harry and Hermione after Ron left, I know some people see that as Harry and Hermione being romantic, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Harry sees his friend is upset and awkwardly tries to make her feel better. There is no romantic tension, just two friends dancing around, trying to distract themselves from what is going on in the world around them. Finally, the Malfoy Manor scene was done really well, and Hermione's torture was heartbreaking, Emma did a really good job.

Deathly Hallows Part 2 - what can I say? The end of the series, I loved the dragon scene, and I just need to express the cinematography of the battle of hogwarts. I mean, it was absolutely beautifully done, the shield around Hogwarts, the death eaters breaking it, the battle as a whole, AHH, just loved it. And the music was also beautiful, and added so much to the movie. Harry meeting Voldemort in the forbidden forest, Harry fighting and killing Voldemort, the movie as a whole. I honestly have no words, it was just an amazing climax to the series.

100,m466rs,Hermione in the movies is way too.....NICE.,"There's always been something that bothers me about Hermione's portrayal in the movies that I haven't been able to articulate until recently.

In the books, Hermione can be really *mean.* But that aspect of her personality is only shown, at best, in parts of the first film, before stripping away not just her mean streak, but most of her self-confidence.

In PoA, there are a *lot* of harsh and tactless comments that Hermione makes towards Ron that the film cut out.

In GoF, Hermione doesn't really care about Ron's jealousy during the Yule Ball and she has a great time. The movie added that bit where she breaks down in tears on the steps.

Perhaps the most succinct example of this is this one line in Order of the Phoenix, present in both the book and the film:

&gt;“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.

You read that? *""Nastily,""* that's the word used. In the movie, however, Emma Watson says the line so meekly that you can barely hear her, it's like Hermione is afraid to say it.

It's really no wonder that so many people who watched the movies first hated the Ron/Hermione romance. The movies changed it from two stubborn equals sparring with each other to an idiot asshole bullying a girl with self-confidence issues for seven years. Even some people who read the books first have turned against it, and I think that's larely because the movies have replaced the books in the popular consciousness in a lot of ways, since people tend to rewatch movies a lot more than they reread books, and visual images get more stuck in your brain than just your imagination from text.

There's this narrative in the fandom that Emma Watson was absolutely perfect for Hermione and no one else could have played her, but the performance just doesn't reflect that.",2021-03-13 13:22:14,0,discussion,156,0.89,0,1,156,0,81,0,0,0,Sat,5,1,"Hermione in the movies is way too.....NICE.

After re-reading the HP books, I thought about fantastic beasts and of course there are gaping holes about the timeline involved in that franchise, but I was thinking more about the cliff hanger which the second movie left us with.

Even in the books, Grindelwald doesn't give up on the information about how Dumbledore has the elder wand (which of course is shown the opposite in the movies, where he gives away that information).

115,m4q9dw,Problems of scale,"Basically every year has 5 girls and 5 boys per house. It's never mentioned, but it's assumed as you would figure that it would be commented on if the Gryffindors were an anomaly. The five boys in Harry's year are clear, but, famously, there are two mystery Gryffindor girls in his year (speculation on names and identities is widespread, so not for this post). Instead, we see here a problem of scale. The UK wizarding community has one major school. At that school, we see a school with about 70 students graduating each year. A tiny school, really. 

1) Why do they need a whole castle? Even if you consider the living spaces, this is a tiny school population. Even if you consider people taught at home, it's tiny. 

2) A ministry of magic with a widescale operation? For a population only large enough to have 70 graduates at their only real school? Towns with high schools with 70 students graduating have a mayor who probably owns a store in town. Maybe a three-person city council. Maybe. But a whole ministry? You'd need every single graduate to live for a hundred years or more and then to also work in the ministry to justify the scale we see in the books. And even then, it's not at all enough.

3) Everyone knows Stan Shunpike, a guy who works on a bus. Stan at the Leaky Cauldron. The one wand salesman. This indicates that the world is pretty darn small. There's one bank, one bookstore, one robe shop, etc. We get no hint that, outside of maybe Hogsmead, there's a larger world. I briefly lived in a town of 4000 that had five banks and no hospitals. The wizarding world is half that size and has one bank and a full-scale hospital. It doesn't add up. 

It's why the first three books and the last three books seem to be in two different universes. The student body needs to be drastically larger, but, even as small as it is, we still have two mystery girls in Harry's own house.

My Goodreads Ratings
Sorcerer's Stone: ***
Chamber of Secrets: ****
Prisoner of Azkaban: ****
Goblet of Fire: *****
Order of the Phoenix: ***
Half-Blood Prince: *****
Deathly Hallows: ****

The highlights of the series for me were Goblet of Fire and Half-Blood Prince. Both were solid stories that had good through line driving the main story from beginning to end. Azkaban would come next. My biggest issue with it is that I think entirely too much of the story hinges on exposition given in the Shrieking Shack. If that had been spread out a bit more or more clues dropped along the way it would be up there with 4 and 6. Chamber of Secrets was the book I knew the most about going into it from having seen at least of the movie in snippets over the years, but that didn't dampen my enjoyment of it. I've been surprised that it seems many think it is the weakest of the series because I enjoy it a lot more than Sorcerer's Stone.

Order of the Phoenix was a pretty big disappointment because it's sitting between two much better books and all of the characters just seem to act dumb all the way through. There's not enough of a consistent through line compared to the better books. I think she really started pulling her punches here. It was somewhat unbelievable that so many wizards could be trying to kill each other and only one ends up dying. It's entirely possible that my enjoyment was somewhat less because it seemed very topical at the time I was reading it. The Ministry denying the return of Voldemort felt extremely similar to me to a certain president thinking they had won an election in terms of how both were so far divorced from reality. This is the chapter in which I think the movie improves on many aspects. The Ministry of Magic and the battle at the end of the story was much more impressive to me on film than it was on the page. I've not yet watched the last 3 movies.

Deathly Hallows was a mixed bag and the book I'm still trying to make up my mind about. It doesn't feel to me like she had the actual mechanics of the endgame mapped out well enough. I think if she had then some of Dumbledore's history would have fit better in book 6 alongside the histories of Voldemort and Snape. The search for the horcruxes is a nice extension from book 6, but the Hallows seem to come out of nowhere. The Battle of Hogwarts is ultimately fairly satisfying but again she pulls her punches with there being only 3 named characters amongst the rows and rows of dead in the Great Hall. The logic behind the ownership of the Elder Wand also leaves something to be desired. I think I have finally gotten my head wrapped around it but it took a lot of thought and conversation with multiple other people to really figure it out. And finally it was probably too much to expect, but I think it would have been a much stronger ending if she had allowed Harry to stay dead. The logic of the prophecy and how he is able to come back from the dead again is another one that strains the mind. It could have been worked around by allowing Neville to ultimately vanquish Voldemort following Harry's final sacrifice.

I'm still trying to decide whether I think JKR was any good at planning ahead or just really good at taking old stuff and making it fit what she needed (diary later becomes Horcrux, Dumbledore tells Harry Voldemort cannot die, mention of Grindelwald in book 1). I've been listening to the Binge Mode HP podcasts since finishing the series (currently on book 3) and they seem to think it was good planning. I think the biggest argument against JKR being good at planning is that the Deathly Hallows is not mentioned at all until book 7. If she had been able to work anything in ahead of time, it would have been much more satisfying of a conclusion.",2021-03-13 17:58:28,0,discussion,32,0.89,0,0,32,0,14,0,0,0,Sat,5,1,"Just completed Harry Potter after actively avoiding the series for 20 years, first thoughts and analysis When the books and films first came out my family like many others were caught up in the hype.

119,m4blco,The Man With Two Faces,"Rereading the books for the first time in a long while, and just finished the first one. Spoilers ahead.

The final chapter of the book is titled ""The Man With Two Faces"". Obviously this is referring to Quirrel who turns out is not who he seems to be, and also literally has a second face on the back of his head.

But this time around it struck me that is not the only man with two faces in this chapter. After his confrontation with Quirrel, Harry wakes up in the hospital and has a lengthy conversation with Dumbledore. Dumbledore at first seems like a kind, wise old man who always has everyone's best interest in mind, though later on in the series we come to realize this isn't necessarily the case. He has a habit of concealing the truth from people and sort of uses them to achieve greater ends.

Hermione even mentions in this chapter that Dumbledore may not be so noble as he seems at first. Harry says something like ""I think Dumbledore intended for me to go after the stone."" To which Hermione replies ""That's really terrible! You could have died!"" And she's right. Dumbledore had no way of knowing that the trio would make it through the ordeal ok, and should never have left the school if he thought they were going after the stone. Especially if Dumbledore suspected Voldemort was involved.

But even further than that Snape is revealed in this chapter to also be two-faced!  Throughout the book he's a bitter mean-spirited bully, but in this chapter Dumbledore reveals that Snape is in fact a decent person at heart. 

It's clever theming from Rowling that went over my head as a kid.",2021-03-13 18:02:05,0,discussion,32,0.9,0,0,32,0,10,0,0,0,Sat,5,1,"The Man With Two Faces Rereading the books for the first time in a long while, and just finished the first one. Spoilers ahead.

120,m4ph6t,The Half Blood Prince Movie: A Disgrace To The Book,"To me half blood prince book is a masterpiece. Its my second favourite book in the series and closely second. This a alot of hp fans least favourite movie and I can understand but the criticisms feel oddly similar when someone reviews this movie. Doesn't mean that the review is bad it just feels like deja vu sometimes, but me I wanna focus on the stuff that I just despised in this movie and without further ado let us begin.

**1. DRACO MALFOY**

For real Half of this movie is basically just sad Draco scenes and I hate it. For context Draco is one of my least favourite characters, I really hate him so much. But in this book, he's the most interesting I love his plan in this book and harry's obsession with Draco, its so fun to read. His full entire plan is not even shown in the movie, we don't see him using crabbe and Goyle at all or him putting the imperious curse on rosmerta, and that annoys me to death. Its so much fun seeing all of this stuff just unravel in the end, its like such a amazing moment seeing his full plan come together seeing him explain it to Dumbledore and  without it, it just kinda makes Dumbledore's death scene kinda pointless. In the books the chapter is not just Dumbledore dying, Its Draco's plan that gets told and everything all the little clues in the books, start to make sense. All the books have this its used best in POA and GOF, but idk man something about it being here is amazing. Draco In the other movies didn't really feel like a threat at all, I mean even in this one he just seems sad and mopey and he's ''misunderstood'' like wtf. Draco used the unforgivable curse on an innocent lady, almost used crucio on harry, let death eaters into the castle, scarred bills face, tried to poison Dumbledore but poisoned Ron instead and gave Katie bell a cursed necklace. But he's still the '''misunderstood''' wtf, And yes I am blaming the movie for this bcz they don't show him as evil as he was in the books.

**2. HARRY AND DUMBLEDORE**

This book had a job to make harry and Dumbledore's relationship feel genuine so harry can feel betrayed by him in the next book. But in this movie harry and Dumbledore just seem like how they were in like book 1. In this book harry becomes Dumbledore's man through and through ( a line they left out of the movie wtf) Dumbledore and harry becomes more than just a student and headmaster relationship, no line exemplifies this better than this line:

*“I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.”*

This is right after what happened in the cave for context, Dumbledore just relived his worst memory ever, fought off inferi, is weak as Frick and he still puts his trust In harry. What a legend, The movie however is not interested in any of this stuff and throws it out the window. ( same thing they did in DH) Its like do the filmmakers even care about Dumbledore and harry? I don't think so and that is unacceptable. Harry and Dumbledore's relationship is what defines book 6 for me, after not talking to harry for almost year, Dumbledore need to reconnect with harry and reconnect he does. Cutting this out is way too stupid and I will never understand why they did it or why nobody even cares.

**3. SEVERUS SNAPE**

I don't want to a Snape debate so lets just forget about that. This book is truly when harry hates Snape. This is the books when he hear about the fact that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy, and is furious and to top it all of he kills Dumbledore. Might I add what an amazing scene Imma talk about more but damn I love Dumbledore's death. The fact that harry saw the half blood prince book as a friend more than a guide really says something, he trusted that book to help him with his potions work, even used it to save Ron and used it to get Slughorn's memory. And when harry finds out its actually Snape who was it its an amazing reveal and I love it so much. The movie doesn't really earn that reveal, they barely mention the half blood prince and Snape isn't as mean or cruel as he is in the books. So it makes it feel like a throw away line, when its not. The book is called the half blood prince, why did anyone think it was a good idea to cut this out? its a fucking disgrace. They butchered the book. They ruined it. 

**4. HARRY'S OBSESSION**

In the entire series, This is in the only book where harry is actually right and I love that. Nobody believes him or cares enough to believe. Tonks, Mr Weasley, Lupin, Dumbledore, Mcgonnagoll, Ron, Hermione didn't believe him with his Draco death eater theory and the fact that he was right, makes the reveal much more sad and impactful, Think about it in all the other books harry was wrong.

Book 1: harry thinks Snape is stealing the stone

Book 2: harry thinks Draco is the heir of Slytherin

Book 3: harry thinks Sirius is bad

Book 4: harry thinks karkaroff put his name in the goblet

Book 5: harry thinks Voldemort is after a weapon

Book 7: harry thinks the deathly hallows symbol is an eye

But in book 6, harry was right. I don't really get that same feeling in the movie though, because they barely focus on it. Harry doesn't camp outside the room of requirement, he doesn't send Kreacher and Dobby, he doesn't watch the marauders map constantly looking for Draco, he doesn't eavesdrop on him during the apparition lessons, he doesn't send Ron and Hermione to check the castle when he leaves to go with Dumbledore, You see my point? none of this is included. That just kinda makes this movie feel like a disgrace to the book which it is. This movie is falling apart hard, like really hard.

**5. THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER**

This is one of my favourite chapters in the entire series. I Love this chapter so much its honestly beautiful, lets see how the movie holds up. Why the hell does Dumbledore apparate on the astronomy tower? out of all places that bruh. In the books harry's under the cloak and he's frozen in place so that he has to watch everything, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape. He could not move or talk, he can only watch. Dumbledore will never help harry again, he'll never explain anything to him ever again, he won't see the piercing blue eyes anymore. The movie doesn't feel like that, we don't get to see the full extent of harry and Dumbledore's relationship, they just seem like headmaster and student and not friends. After everything that happened that night, he heard Dumbledore begging for death, he heard the full extent of Draco's plan, he saw the dark mark in the sky and thought someone died, Hearing Dumbledore begging for mercy to Snape, scared harry more than anything that he ever experienced that night, that shook harry to the core, even just hearing the line ''Severus please'' brings me to tears every time. The movie doesn't really have that same feeling, it should have it but it doesn't. And even after Dumbledore died and harry saw his body the locket was open, and he found out that Dumbledore had died for nothing, they didn't get the horcrux. Now that is truly heartbreaking and for the first time in the series harry starts to cry. Its weird seeing our main character break down like this and worst of all, when Fawkes plays a lament to honour Dumbledore, even though he never hear the song, you can still feel the emotion. The movie is not like this at all it ruins everything that made this book so powerful ad heartbreaking, and I hate it for that. This line always bring me to tears when I read this book too:

*And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.*

Reading the ending of this book solidified this as my second favourite book of all time, but the movie doesn't even come close to the level of brilliance of this book. It never can and will, is the half blood prince a disgrace to the book? Yes. It deserves this rating of...

The movie doesn't really earn that reveal, they barely mention the half blood prince and Snape isn't as mean or cruel as he is in the books. So it makes it feel like a throw away line, when its not. The book is called the half blood prince, why did anyone think it was a good idea to cut this out? its a fucking disgrace. They butchered the book. They ruined it. 

**4. HARRY'S OBSESSION**

In the entire series, This is in the only book where harry is actually right and I love that. Nobody believes him or cares enough to believe. Tonks, Mr Weasley, Lupin, Dumbledore, Mcgonnagoll, Ron, Hermione didn't believe him with his Draco death eater theory and the fact that he was right, makes the reveal much more sad and impactful, Think about it in all the other books harry was wrong.

Book 1: harry thinks Snape is stealing the stone

Book 2: harry thinks Draco is the heir of Slytherin

Book 3: harry thinks Sirius is bad

Book 4: harry thinks karkaroff put his name in the goblet

Book 5: harry thinks Voldemort is after a weapon

Book 7: harry thinks the deathly hallows symbol is an eye

But in book 6, harry was right. I don't really get that same feeling in the movie though, because they barely focus on it. Harry doesn't camp outside the room of requirement, he doesn't send Kreacher and Dobby, he doesn't watch the marauders map constantly looking for Draco, he doesn't eavesdrop on him during the apparition lessons, he doesn't send Ron and Hermione to check the castle when he leaves to go with Dumbledore, You see my point? none of this is included. That just kinda makes this movie feel like a disgrace to the book which it is. This movie is falling apart hard, like really hard.

**5. THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER**

This is one of my favourite chapters in the entire series. I Love this chapter so much its honestly beautiful, lets see how the movie holds up. Why the hell does Dumbledore apparate on the astronomy tower? out of all places that bruh. In the books harry's under the cloak and he's frozen in place so that he has to watch everything, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape. He could not move or talk, he can only watch. Dumbledore will never help harry again, he'll never explain anything to him ever again, he won't see the piercing blue eyes anymore. The movie doesn't feel like that, we don't get to see the full extent of harry and Dumbledore's relationship, they just seem like headmaster and student and not friends. After everything that happened that night, he heard Dumbledore begging for death, he heard the full extent of Draco's plan, he saw the dark mark in the sky and thought someone died, Hearing Dumbledore begging for mercy to Snape, scared harry more than anything that he ever experienced that night, that shook harry to the core, even just hearing the line ''Severus please'' brings me to tears every time. The movie doesn't really have that same feeling, it should have it but it doesn't. And even after Dumbledore died and harry saw his body the locket was open, and he found out that Dumbledore had died for nothing, they didn't get the horcrux. Now that is truly heartbreaking and for the first time in the series harry starts to cry. Its weird seeing our main character break down like this and worst of all, when Fawkes plays a lament to honour Dumbledore, even though he never hear the song, you can still feel the emotion. The movie is not like this at all it ruins everything that made this book so powerful ad heartbreaking, and I hate it for that. This line always bring me to tears when I read this book too:

*And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.*

Reading the ending of this book solidified this as my second favourite book of all time, but the movie doesn't even come close to the level of brilliance of this book. It never can and will, is the half blood prince a disgrace to the book? Yes. It deserves this rating of...

Fast forward to last month, I was on holiday for school and just thought I’d binge all the movies. I’ve never read the books (have never been much of a reader, but when I have gotten the occasional book I like in English class, I get hooked) Binged all eight movies in less than a week, then binged them again right after. I was just so addicted. Although I’ve seen people say they can’t imagine following the story without reading the books, I felt so connected to the characters, even with their apparently noticeable flaws (from the books)

I had two “questions” I hope to get answered in this post. Firstly, should I get into the books? I feel like the obvious answer is yes, but did I kind of ruin it by watching the movies first? Or will I still be able to enjoy it and learn the characters again, as I’ve been told again and again that they’re all better in the books. Secondly, how do you guys cope with this not being real?

139,m49no2,ALL CAPS Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Once upon a time a couple months ago, yours truly thought it would be cool to see how a book would read when only reading what people shout in all caps. Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

141,m3s1qr,"""Well now,"" said a small voice from somewhere within the inky blackness.","""What have we here?"" The boy froze. 

""This one seems...familiar"" the voice continued. He could feel his heart beating against the inside of his chest. This couldn't be real, he thought. ""Oh, but it *is* real!"" the voice replied, almost as though it had heard him think. This time the boy jumped from the shock. 

*'Can you hear my thoughts?'* he said aloud in his mind. ""Your thoughts, yes, but much more than that, boy"" said the voice. ""I can see you, too. Who you are, who you might be, all the potential deep within..."" The boy took a steadying breath. Then, again in his mind, he spoke. *'You can see who I am?'* His own voice sounded unsure in his head, for the boy really didn't know who he was himself when he thought about it. 

""I can."" replied the voice. It was a soft, yet confident voice with a sharpness to it that suggested wisdom and maturity. ""I see promise, oh yes, such promise. Nearly fearless too, except for that..."" The boy screwed up his face at this. *'I am NOT scared of anything!'* he thought defiantly. 

But the voice continued on, undeterred. ""You'd make a good leader, a great one even. But there's more to you isn't there? A strong desire to prove yourself, to show the world what you can be."" Now the boy just sat, quite still, listening intently. He was starting to like what he heard, and with it he relaxed a little. As he did so, he subconsciously opened more of himself up to the all-encompassing darkness surrounding him. 

""What's this?"" the voice said softly ""You don't just want to show the world... You want to bend it to your will."" The boy said nothing in his head, but allowed memories to bubble to the surface. Memories of the people who had already seen that part of him, of people who *would* see that part of him one day. 

""I haven't seen a mind like this in almost a thousand years..."" said the voice, only now it wasn't so confident. It almost seemed fearful, as if it had seen something in this small boy that ought not to have been seen. Centuries seemed to pass by in an instant, a rushing, roaring sound rose up, dreadful in the blackness and the boy felt his heart racing, but this time it was an altogether different sensation. A rush of adrenaline that made him feel giddy. The voice understood now not just who this boy was, but why he seemed so familiar too. 

""Salazar..."" it said, in a hushed, quiet tone before roaring ""SLYTHERIN!"" out loud to the great hall.

I find that it was the book that truly laid down the crucial foundation of the whole series. In addition to horcruxes (sp?) we are also introduced to:

-The Vanishing cabinet (instrumental in book 6)***

-The hand of glory (seen again in book 6.) We also get a glimpse at how Burkes knows his dark magic/objects real well. He has perfected his craft to the t. A saviness we see repeatedly displayed in HBP. 


-Elf magic in that it doesn't obey the normal laws of wizard magic i.e. how dobby bewitched platform 9 &amp; 3/4 to be impenetrable, used the hover charm in the muggles' house and bewitched a bludger right in the middle of  hogwarts field ALL without being detected as the source of these oddities by not only the bumbling of a govt body, which is the MoM, but also by intelligent, skilled and astute wizards and witches like Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Madam pomfery (sp?) or Flitwick [assuming all these faculty were within the vicinity of when the bludger was acting up.] Elf magic of course becomes a HUGE plot line in book 6/7 re: RAB, Kreacher's tale.

***EDIT: I want to clarify that I understand CoS offers a whole lot more story than the points I made.

That adventure piqued Draco's curiosity and interest in the transitional nature of the device. He later spent months trying to fix it and finally succeeding.

165,m47x96,Ron is more Slytherin than Harry. Harry is more Hufflepuff!,"There’s often discussion in fandom about what houses (other than Gryffindor) the trio could fit in, specifically that they each represent another house. The most straightforward is Hermione in Ravenclaw. Then, due to Harry’s connection with Voldemort (among other things) makes Harry the representative of Slytherin. And Ron is considered the Hufflepuff. 

I understand these arguments, and I think they’re based on actions and abilities, whereas I’m going to base this on motivations.

I find Harry to be more of a Hufflepuff because he cares about all people. He selflessly wants to save the Wizarding World, not for fame but simply to save people. Yes, he feels like it’s his destiny, but he could ignore this if he really didn’t want to. Harry saves Fleur’s sister in the 2nd task, even though he doesn’t know her. He does know this will hurt his chances in winning the Triwizard Tournament. Harry attempts to save Draco, Crabbe, &amp; Goyle from the fiendfyre, his enemies who set the fire to hurt him! 

Ron on the other hand represents Slytherin. Ron is so dedicated and fiercely protective of his family, he’d put his family before anything/anyone else - Slytherins are know for their loyalty. Ron is extremely loyal and usually his disagreements with Harry and Hermione start when he feels they were disloyal towards him. He’s upset that Harry didn’t tell him about the tournament, he thinks it is Harry being disloyal! This is a good quality of Ron’s and represents Slytherin positively. On a more negative side, Ron can be selfish. In the mirror of Erised he sees himself successful, and better than his family (though not at their expense).

194,m3nckv,My biggest problem with how Slytherins are portrayed in the series,"It’s become a pretty popular opinion that Slytherin house being portrayed as the constant ‘bad guys’ throughout the whole series is stupid, and I definitely do agree with that. However, I think it’s only my second biggest complaint about Slytherin.

The worst thing about how Slytherin was written is that we don’t see *any* Slytherins with actual ‘Slytherin traits’ throughout the series. The house is supposed to value cunning and ambitious wizards, but none of the Slytherins we see are either of those. In fact most are portrayed as being pretty stupid and unmotivated. The *real* defining trait (as far as what we see goes) is just being a racist rich kid and a bully.

Draco isn’t clever or cunning, he’s just a predjudiced jerk. Crabbe and Goyle... goes without saying. Pansy is just a sycophant and by JKR’s own admission the ‘anti-Hermione’. And none of the others are any better.

195,m3uuia,I've finshed the series. What do I do now?,"Hello, this is my first ever post to reddit, I'm not one to ever post online but after discovering this subreddit and finishing the books I felt that I had to post. I apologise if this post is a bit messy, I'm nervous about my first post!  
As the title says I've just finished the Harry Potter series. I grew up with an older sibling that was and still is very fond of Harry Potter, and yet, despite them making me watch the Philosophers Stone over and over again on video until it didn't work anymore, and being lucky enough to be taken to the cinema to watch every film, I never really experienced the Harry Potter series. I did not remember much at all from the films (apart from The Philosophers Stone). I had somehow managed to avoid ever finding out what happens in the books and movies, which is something I am very grateful for.   
I decided to read the books because I was desperate to become immesered in something.  


Anyway, here I am after 2 months! I have read all of the books and watched all of the movies, expect for the Deathly Hallows which I am watching over the weekend. I feel as I assume others also have, very sad! I was, and am still so obssessed with this series and I don't really know what to do with myself now, this is something that has helped me so much with lockdown depression and I'm not ready to finish it. So my question is: Does anyone have any tips on where to go from here? I know there are other books, which I have now ordered to read.

198,m2w08f,the writers ruined ginnys characters in the movies,"currently reading DH and something i read stuck out to me.

when harry broke the news to ginny that he could no longer be with her bc the danger it posed to her, she did not cry. and harry said that this was one of the many reasons that he fell for ginny. she was hardly teary bc she just...understood. 

book ginny, as ive gathered, is so much more independent, and strong willed than movie ginny.

take slughorns tea party fiasco for instance. ginny was late to the party in the event of her and dean breaking up and she came in crying. harry, the white knight, then stood up from the table so as to draw more attention to himself so no one would see ginny crying.

now as sweet as this may seem it rubs me the wrong way. it gives off the notiom that ginny needed a saviour and that she could not fend for herself. and if you've read the books you'd know that that is not ginny at all!

not only is she a powerful witch and quick on her feet in the face of danger, but she's opinionated and will not allow anyone to walk all over her or tell her what to do. 

*flashback to the scene of her telling ron off for being a git abt her snogging whomever she likes lmao*

as i was saying, having ginny cry over something as stupid as a boy is beneath her and unlike her.

ginny was a badass bitty and i will never forgive the movies for downplaying her character AND her and harrys level of intimacy.

235,m3lp4b,Why didn't Remus wonder about two Harrys and Hermiones on the map in PoA?,"I was wondering... 

In Prisoner of Azkaban (somewhere around chapter 20) Remus said that he watched the trio on the Marauder's Map because he assumed they would go to Hargid for Buckbeaks execution.

Later that night when Harry and Hermione used the timeturner to go back, they hid in a broom closet and even hear ther past selfes walking by. They followed them to Hargid and always were quite close by.

So what happened with them on the map? It seems the map couldn't be fooled easily and I think it just would have shown them twice since they were there double at the same time. Didn't Remus wonder about that? He surely would have seen them if he kept such a close eye on them at that time.

*What do you think would have changed if he saw them twice? How would he have reacted? What would he have done?*

SS/PS is Harry because this is the book that focuses most souly on him out of all of the books 

Cos is the diary because duh

PoA is nagini because she is a human who is forced to be a snake which is similar to lupin who the book focuses on as well as the marauded who are aimagi

GoF is the cup because it partiall focuses on Cedric a hufflepuff also a goblet is similar to a cup and there is the Triwizard cup

OotP is the diadem because we see a lot of cho and Luna both raven laws and Da meetings take place in the room of requirement where the diadem is hidden

HBP is the ring because we learn a lot about the Gaunts who the ring originally belonged to and dumbledore putting the ring on is integral to the plot and his death.

DH Is the locket because this is the book where we find it destroy it and it fucks up there time in the forest. And the locked was used on some special editions for the book.

254,m40jhq,Did Voldemort have a point? - the origins of Pure-Blood Supremacy,"Something that is never really explained is the rationale and history of the anti-muggle/muggle-born ideology held by people such as the Malfoy’s and other death eaters.

The first, obvious explanation is that it’s simply a stand-in for racism and other forms of bigotry and discrimination and therefore Voldemort is Hitler and the whole thing is a sort of metaphor for real history. 

That explanation works up to a point but the history of the Wizarding World and its relations with muggles reveals a more complicated picture. As far as we know  the existence of wizards is hidden from the muggles because witches and wizards were persecuted in previous centuries. This fact provides part of the explanation for these attitudes - they are motivated by resentment and fear of their historical persecutors - but there are other things to consider. 

It is striking how powerful witches and wizards are by the time the story is set. People like Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape etc are easily powerful enough to allow the wizarding world to live without fear of abuse by muggles. This must mean that in the time since the wizarding world went underground magic has become more potent and wizards have become more powerful. 

My theory is that contact with muggles diminishes the power of witches and wizards. The fear of death eaters is that by admitting muggle-borns into Hogwarts and Wizarding World their great magic-based civilisation built over the last few centuries could disappear and they would return to the days of their persecution and weaker magic. This would mean that there is at least some point to Voldemort’s cause other than simple prejudice.",2021-03-13 06:11:04,0,question,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,0,Sat,5,1,"Did Voldemort have a point? - the origins of Pure-Blood Supremacy Something that is never really explained is the rationale and history of the anti-muggle/muggle-born ideology held by people such as the Malfoy’s and other death eaters.

256,m30wc9,Just realised Bathilda Bagshot was a Grindelwald supporter.,"Deathly Hallows spoilers ig but the book’s been out for 13 years and the movie’s been out for 10, so that’s on you for being in the HP Reddit before you finished the series. 

EDIT: If you have a reason why you don’t think this is true I’d love to hear it and discuss it but if it starts with ‘maybe’ I don’t wanna know. I’m talking about what’s literally on the pages. 

Bathilda Bagshot was a Grindelwald supporter; Why else would she have his photograph framed and on display in her home fifty years after his defeat? That should have been gone before Fantastic Beasts in the 1920s, but it’s still there on Christmas Eve 1997, when Harry is in her house. This is a man who slaughtered thousands of people, a man who’s existence in history is treated much the same as Hitler’s. Aka, we all know he’s irredeemably bad, anyone who says otherwise is a big red flag.

Bathilda took him in for the summer after he was EXPELLED FROM DURMSTRANG. She most likely didn’t know the details but would surely come to the same conclusion as the reader does - what messed up thing do you have to do to get expelled from the school that literally teaches the dark arts? She states that he was a charming boy ‘whatever he became later’. That’s a pretty dismissive way to talk about this universe’s Hitler fifty years later. There’s no ‘whatever’ about genocide. 
She notes on how Grindelwald and Dumbledore were very close. (😉) she shows Rita Skeeter a letter from Dumbledore to Grindelwald, that clearly states they want to subjugate the muggles ‘for the greater good’. Grindelwald was not keeping his plans a secret from aunt Bathilda. She knew what he wanted, and then he went out and did it. 
She then says Grindelwald skipped town the day after Ariana died. That could be a coincidence... Except that suddenly Grindelwald and Dumbledore weren’t pals anymore. Dumbledore’s defeat of Grindelwald was a hugely famous historical event. And as a matter of fact, Bathilda’s magnum opus ‘A History of Magic’ was published just two years after Grindelwald was defeated, in 1947.

TLDR; Bathilda took in her nephew for three months who she knew was a violent criminal. He SPOKE OPENLY IN FRONT OF HER OF HIS PLANS TO COMMIT A GENOCIDE, killed a child, left her care, spent forty years committing that genocide very famously and publicly, and got defeated by the brother of the child he killed. Bathilda’s response to this is to keep his photograph framed and on display in her home, and call the bloodshed he caused ‘whatever’, and focus more on how charming he was.

In the book, you really get to see another side of Harry. You see how our hero is flawed, and throughout the book, instead of focusing on Dumbledore's mission, he spends most of the year obsessing about his sworn rival Malfoy, and lets personal feelings get in the way of his duty. This all comes to a head in the scene in the bathroom, when Malfoy is crying. All of a sudden, there is a role reversal. Harry was always the underdog, the kid being bullied or standing up for the bullied, and Malfoy was nothing but an arrogant brat. Now we see Malfoy as a kid who is stuck in an impossible situation, having been tasked by the Dark Lord with killing his headmaster, a man he may not love the way Harry does, but who has nevertheless been an authority figure throughout his childhood, and despite his family's dislike of Dumbledore, for Draco it is probably impossible to imagine a world without him, being such a huge part of Hogwarts, the school which is, as it is a boarding school, a second home of sorts for all its students (although for Harry it probably feels like his first real home). In the process of trying to get to Dumbledore (in very indirect ways), Malfoy also ends up hurting other students, which must also have taken a toll on him. When Harry walks in on Malfoy in the bathroom, we realize that now it is Malfoy that is the underdog, the kid whose father has been shown to be much less powerful than he first appeared, and whose family is under the thumb of the Dark Lord, and Draco is caught between a rock and a hard place. Harry, on the other hand, is the kid whose hatred of Malfoy has blinded him to the point where all he cares about is getting him, and he is unable to see that Draco might actually be in a difficult position. His hatred of Malfoy blinds him from having empathy for him, despite the fact that he notices that Malfoy has been looking pale and distraught throughout the school year. When he releases the Sectumsempra spell, he almost unwittingly murders Draco, after having humiliated him by walking in on him whilst he was crying. In the movie, however, when he sees Malfoy crying, he simply starts yelling at him, which implies to the audience that his indignation is righteous. Also in the film, after using the Sectumsempra spell, he doesn't get punished (after almost killing another student), but instead gets taken into the Room of Requirement by his friend's sister to hide the book and get a kiss. It is implied that it is mostly the book that's evil, and not Harry that is in the wrong for using a spell he didn't know (labelled ""For Enemies"") from a book he found, although he should clearly have known better.

297,m2sau3,If you could change any specific situation on the Harry Potter series what would you change?,"So I was discussing this the other day with my friend, and I was wondering: if given the chance, what's the one thing you would change in the Harry Potter series. 

It can be a small thing, like clothes, or as major as undoing a character's death. You can be as specific or superficial as you want, but it can only be one thing. I'd also love to know why and how that would change the series in your opinion!

For me it would have to be keeping Sirius alive! I'd love to keep everyone alive, but I would love to see Sirius bonding with Harry, his dead best friend's son, after so much trauma. Telling stories about James, Lily and Remus of course! Helping each other through the hardest times and Harry and Sirius finally having someone they could always rely on, grieving together and just going about life with each other!

What about you?",2021-03-11 15:08:12,0,discussion,51,0.91,0,0,51,0,186,0,0,0,Thurs,3,1,"If you could change any specific situation on the Harry Potter series what would you change?

298,m2i4hq,I am a few short years away from being able to relive Harry Potter through my stepdaughter.,"About a year and a half ago, I started reading to my stepdaughter before she went to bed. I tried for a couple months, but she was rough to read to. She'd get way too distracted and couldn't actually follow the story and would interrupt every other word. So eventually we transitioned into us trading off every other page in books at her reading level so she could practice but not feel like she had to do EVERYTHING.

A few weeks ago when she was here, she asked if I would read to her while she was in the shower (which I tried doing a year ago because I thought it might be less distracting). I decided, ""Eh, fuck it. Let's see how this goes.""

I read two whole chapters of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe to her, and she only interrupted once to ask what a word meant. It was incredible.

Tonight I decided to see if we could continue the book. She was able to tell me the general gist of what happened in the two chapters up to that point, and when we were done with the third chapter, she could tell me 95% of what happened. And then we practiced making predictions about what we think is going to happen in the next chapter. 

After she went to sleep, I realized... She will soon be able to follow books with slightly longer chapters. Which means I will soon get to read Harry Potter to her and get to relive all of the magic through her eyes! I am so excited!!",2021-03-11 04:52:14,0,discussion,292,0.96,0,1,292,0,25,0,0,0,Thurs,3,1,"I am a few short years away from being able to relive Harry Potter through my stepdaughter.

334,m36agg,Hermione's parents would have not been able to emigrate to Australia.,"In my opinion, JKR didn't look very far in the immigration issue when she wrote her book. Having gone through the hoops of the Australian Department of Border Protection (or whatever it's called nowadays), let me tell you: the days where you could just go on holidays and decided to stay are long gone.
There is Paper Work, More Paperwork, and Long Waiting Times. 

First issue: the change of name: magic works on people and things, but not on electrical items, even back in the days, everything was getting computerised:  passport, birth certificate, police records, bank account, tax details, pensions. The ""Wendells"" might have thought that was their name, but they would have run in trouble the moment they wanted to prove their ID to the Australian government.

Now even imagining that Hermione's spell would have changed their ID in a way that doesn't look suspicious there is still the issue of getting a visa, they would have either needed a sponsorship for a job, or to set up their own business. In both case it would have taken a few months to organise: either finding a job and getting the visa approved, or setting up a business plan and finding the finances and  getting a visa approved.

And lastly, Hermione's parents seem, at least middle class, from which we can imagine that the would have brought their house, and probably have their own dental practice too. Once again, it would have taken a few months to sell the house and sell the business (because moving country is expensive, they couldn't just go cheap and leave everything behind).

I'm guessing it would have taken at the very least 3 months before the leave the UK, but with a more realistic 6 months timeframe. Maybe even more, as given Hermione's personality, we can guess that they would have been the kind of people to be organised and careful in their preparations. By that time, either the Death Eaters have already paid them a visit and they would probably be dead, or they'd be boarding the plane just as the WW is finishing, rendering the whole ordeal pointless.

335,m3cg30,Dracos deleted scene HARRY POTTER SPOILERS AHEAD YOU'VE BEEN WARNED,"Hi so im new to this reddit page but im a big potterhead ive read all the harry potter books and watched all the films but stopped at the fantastic beast movies becouse i just couldn't get in to it hopefully one day ill get past the 1st fantastic beast film.
I was on the internet when i saw this scene i had never seen extended or deleted.
Anyway in the final movie of the harry potter theres a scene where hagrid is holding a (faking) dead harry potter and voldermort tells everyone he is dead and who will join the death eaters now before this all the Slytherin members (not including draco) were locked in my gous is so they could be written out of the story line and for draco to hesitantly join with encouragement from this parents and aunt with him also having the most awkward hug ive ever seen between draco and voldermort. Now after this Neville gives this meaning full speech and for harry to roll out of hagrids arms and reveal hes alive and fight back. 
Know in the deleted scene draco throws harry his wand when its revealed hes alive.
know im not saying dracos an angel in fact he's pretty far from it but in my opinion i don't think that scene should be cut. One name that ive heard going around for draco is the boy who didn't have a choice and after dumbeldores death,that awkward moment with voldermort and encouragement from his family i just feel like even though everything it should have stayed in the movie.
plus i remember this end scene from the movie where we see them as adults with there own kids and harry and draco just had this moment that makes it feel like the scene should have stayed in.
Now thats just my opinion but id love to know what other wizards /muggles think to you agree/disagree and why?

340,m2mmu8,Whats your reception of Moody in GoF today?,"Everytime I re-read the book, re-watch the movie or re-listen the audio books I originally had a hard time to get along with the scenes of Moody. It's basically the most time we spend with his character and even if it is not him, the real Moody in 5,6 &amp; 7 shows no difference in personality. So after knowing the twist with Barty Crouch Jr. I didn't know what to think about the GoF Moody anymore, since all of the scenes stll feel so Moody-like except those where he gives hints about his true intentions.

So I thought that maybe the explanation for this is that he used some kind of hypnosis spell on himself to really be Moody. Otherwise he couldn't possibly fool people like Dumbledore who where lifelong friends with Moody. Even if this is just my headcanon it still gives me peace with the Goblet of Fire Moody because I can see the true Moody in most of those scenes. I mean Crouch had only a few days / weeks before the start of Harrys fourth year and could by no chance learn to behave like Moody in such a detailed way, don't you think?

369,m1xizh,Happy Birthday Remus Lupin,"Some intresting Facts related to him :

* Lyall and Hope , Remus parents had met due to a Boggart
* Remus Lupin was Intended Target of Fenrir Greyback because Lyall had insulted Greyback
* Albus Dumbledore himself had arrived at the Lupin's Doorstep to invite Remus to Hogwarts
* He was awarded Order of Merlin , First Class

I have seen many people say that Relationship between Tonks and Remus was out of nowhere and Tonks Forced Lupin .

Actually it wasnt a Out of Nowhere one . In books it couldnt be explained since Story was From harry's perspective but Later on in Remus Lupin's Biography which was published on Pottermore its very well explained .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*As Lord Voldemort once again gained ascendancy, the old resistance regrouped and Remus found himself once more part of the Order of the Phoenix.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*This time, the group included an Auror who had been too young to belong to the Order during its first incarnation. Clever, brave and funny, pink-haired Nymphadora Tonks was a protégée of Alastor ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody, the toughest and most grizzled Auror of them all.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Remus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the young witch. He had never fallen in love before. If it had happened in peacetime, Remus would have simply taken himself off to a new place and a new job, so that he did not have to endure the pain of watching Tonks fall in love with a handsome, young wizard in the Auror office, which was what he expected to happen. However, this was war; they were both needed in the Order of the Phoenix, and nobody knew what the next day would bring. Remus felt justified in remaining exactly where he was, keeping his feelings to himself but secretly rejoicing every time somebody paired him with Tonks on some overnight mission.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater’s house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He’s still handsome, isn’t he, even after Azkaban?’). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.’). At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You’d know perfectly well who I’ve fallen for, if you weren’t too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.’*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Remus’s immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. He therefore pretended not to understand Tonks, which did not fool her at all. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility. However, he avoided any further excursions with her, barely talked to her, and started volunteering for the most dangerous missions. Tonks became desperately unhappy, convinced not only that the man she loved would never willingly spend time with her again, but also that he might walk to his death rather than admit his feelings.*

385,m22bv7,Old invisibility cloaks: spring fashion lifehack,"Literal shower thought I just had. It's said in the books that Invisibility cloaks (not the Peverell cloak, but general merchandise) turn transparent over time, as their spells wear out. So, you can be seen through the cloak, and it remains invisible, a la the invisible boatmobile. 

But... it's still a cloak. Either a huge shawl or a fitted warming garment, which blocks the wind and traps heat.

As well, we know that early Spring is the big time for fashion sales, and that it's also the most turbulent in terms of weather, with wind, rain, and the occasional snow storms as late as March (northern hemisphere).

So, what do you do if you're totally stoked to wear your thin new Spring threads, but the weather forecast sounds like something Trelawney would portend? Dig through the closet, and whip out that old af invisibility cloak an Uncle gifted you when you were 8!

GOF is my favorite movie adaptation, and I've seen it probably 30 times. 

Yesterday I was watching once again, and during the scene where ""Moody"" (Crouch Jr. obviously) is showing the class the unforgivable curses, I was struck by how long he used the cruciatus curse on the spider. It's obviously bothering Neville as Hermione points out, and I'd never really thought much about that part of the scene before. And then it hit me:

415,m2bpax,I came up with a better plan for Malfoy in HBP,"So we all know that in HBP, Malfoy is tasked with assassinating Dumbledore with his ultimate plan being to get Deatheaters into the school to help him via the vanishing cabinet.

Now presumably, they do this every year with students and Malfoy could easily have figured this out but even if this is unique to this year, then Malfoy could conduct the following plan:

Obtain the hair of a number 6th years currently taking apparition lessons. Supply these to your aunt Bellatrix via meetup in Hogsmede or during Christmas or w/e. Also, give her the date and time of the 10th Apparition lesson with instructions to take polyjuice to become these students and apparate in one-at-a-time during that date.

Wait until the 10th week of Apparition lessons (when students have actually learned to apparate). Make sure the people you took hair from don't show up to apparition lessons (Stupify etc.). Aunty Belatrix and the gang apparate in one at a time posing as students while all other 6 years are trying to apparate blending right in (hopefully lost in the crowd and no one notices you weren't there at the start of the lesson).

432,m1zzg2,"DFW, TX - Potter Themed Proposal","Hello everyone!

This is my first post and I’m at the mercy of Reddit but I need help with an engagement proposal. This is to all magical fans of the HP community. We are both located in PHX Arizona at the moment so physically scouting locations and meeting with people will be difficult. Luckily I have some amazing friends with 360 cameras willing to go to any parks to check them out for me.

I am here on reddit looking for insight into all the HP books, movies and lore to assist with this. We are both Ravenclaw so there is that. I am looking into Snowy Owls and Ravens in the DFW area. If you know of anything that would help make this day more magical feel free to drop comments or DM. If you know someone with special talents in the areas listed below, drop their contact info. 

I will be proposing this July in Dallas TX and I’m looking for some ideas to help make it so magical. I will compensate anyone who assists with this. $$$

Here is a list of what has been floating around my head and what is still missing.

Covered: The ring, I will post pictures of this epic ring later. I promise it’s worth the wait. :)

Needed:

Location: A very magical park in DFW (outdoors because Covid sucks).  
\*No to the Dallas arboretum because my sister's fiance JUST proposed there and I don’t want to copy them.

Cloaks: Family and friends will be waiting for the special moment dressed in cloaks. 

Music: Looking for a small 4 piece quartet of some sort that could play a couple of songs or a local high school band for hire.

Special Effects: Currently looking for any pyrotechs or special effects artists in DFW to assist with little magical effects.

Video/Photographer: Need a Photographer that can do Light writing and a videographer to capture the moment.

Possible scavenger hunt?

I’m reaching out to some Game masters for Escape rooms who may be able to help design a fun scavenger hunt. 

Let me know of any magical extras you may think of that would be perfect for this proposal.

433,m1n6w2,Symbolism/Foreshadowing: DH,"The Deathly Hallows are made up of three magical items: the cloak, the wand, and the stone. When Dumbledore dies, he passed on three items to Hermione, Ron, and Harry: the book, the deluminator, and the snitch. The book has pages, which are flowy and flexible - like a cloak. The deluminator is a small handheld item that can produce light - like a wand. The snitch is a small round object - like a stone (and actually encases the Resurrection Stone).

441,m1s34q,Voldemort Underestimated Love,"...which is how he failed.

Which was the point of the books, that love is the most powerful thing in JK Rowling's view.

From the fact that Voldemort couldn't kill a baby because of love.

To the fact Bellatrix was in love with Voldemort and he neglected/overlooked her as insignificant.

To the fact that his ""most loyal servant"" loved the mother he murdered.

JK Rowling was trying to show that Snape LOVED Lily even after she died. And that is the point of why Voldemort failed.

Because of genuine, bona fide love. Love does not always motivate us to make the right choices. If it did, what a boring, easy, dare I say heavenly world it'd be? It'd be perfection. You meet someone, fall in genuine love, and that's it. Happily ever after. Case dismissed.

That is hardly most people's stories. Humans make the wrong choices. We lose people we genuinely care for. And sometimes maybe we do everything right and still lose them.

But if you think people are never genuinely in love (sometimes they aren't), you're missing the point JK Rowling was trying to show.

That even if you make the wrong choices, even if you lose someone you genuinely care for, even if it's your fault they died in the first place, they can be the one warm part in your heart.

Anyone whose child has died can attest to this: It's not obsession when someone you genuinely love died. Anyone who lost a beloved (nonabusive) spouse can also say such. They still feel his arms around them. REAL love never dies.

Even if Snape never kissed Lily, she was the brightest place in his dark heart. JK Rowling wanted the readers to know he loved her.

I for one think it's tragically beautiful when you love someone unconditionally. Most people don't. They only love someone as long as they're in their face.

Snape carried Lily around in his heart even though she married his bully, the person he hated the most. He loved her even though she never had any idea how he felt about her. Even though they never went on a date or shared a snog.

I mean don't abandon the houses at all but... as we see in the books houses become some kind of defining factor for you. It is odd if more people from different houses switch tables at meals. It shouldn't be like that. Idk what it should be like but not that"

476,m1qyaz,NONE of Them Look Like That,"\*Probably a few do but most had their looks changed\*

I was thinking about the Snape doesn't look like THIS, he looks like THIS thread while reading the first book, and..

Vernon is swapped with Petunia/Dudley in the films. In the books, Vernon is dark haired, the other two blonde. In the movies, it's the reverse.

Hagrid's description: A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

In the books, you can't see anything but his eyes of his face (at least at first). In the movies, you can actually see his face.

Hermione doesn't have buck teeth in the films.

Dumbledore doesn't look weak in the books. (This could've been solved by making a younger actor look old though).

Gilderoy Lockhart is suchahunk Ginny has a crush on him in the book. In the movies, he might be kinda handsome but he's certainly not THAT good-looking.

Umbridge in the book looks like a toad.

Cedric Diggory is supremely handsome in the books. (Sorry, Robert Pattinson, you've been cast as two super attractive dudes but neither time does your face actually look super hot).

Fleur in the books...looks like the human version of a cupcake. Super sweet. Tantalizing. There's even a drawing of her in the fourth book (and, spoiler alert, looks nothing like the actress).

That's NOT how I picture Tonks. Sorry, but...I like my version better (at the movies).

Bellatrix is not hot in the books. She looks tired and from her description, I gather she's rather plain looking but very bold. I LOVE Helena portraying her, but if we're getting technical, that's not how Bellatrix looks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Far as I'm concerned, Draco, Harry, Ron, Luna, McGonagall, Arthur, and Molly probably all do look like they should.

Anyway, I feel all these actors did a splendid job even if their LOOKS didn't match their descriptions via book, their personalities are what matters.

484,m1ftcv,My Wolfstar-owned heart can't help but read too much into this sentence of TDH,"Beware, this is silly. But still, here it goes.

Tonks just arrived at the Burrow with Ron, after the mid-air encounter with death eaters. Remus asks what took them so long, and she answers:

""“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she triedvery  hard  to  kill  me.  I  just  wish  I’d  got  her,  I  owe  Bellatrix.  But  we  definitely  injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she wasfussing over us —”

And then, this is Remus' reaction: 

""*A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.*""

So, Lupin is tense. Definitely feeling... I'd say some supressed anger, mixed with relief. But, ""not being able to say anything else"" also speaks of pain. And emotion. As if everything that *could be said* would be emotionally unbearable. As if the pain'd be too much to handle.

I don't think I ever noticed that line. Maybe because I thought of his reaction as mainly preocupation and angst directed at Tonks, for being vulnerable to Bellatrix. And that's still what I think it is, but at the same time, Bellatrix killed Sirius. It definitely isn't a name without meaning to Remus: it has certain weight in his life, in his present. And, well, I'm a Wolfstar shipper since I first read PoA, but even if I wasn't, *Bellatrix killed Sirius*. His, at the very least, *only living friend*. And now, she tried to kill his *wife**.* 

So I don't think it's only fear of losing Tonks what Remus is feeling. He's thinking of Sirius, as well. Fear of losing her, in exactly the same way he lost  Sirius.

494,m13cum,In Defence of Snape,"Hello All,  

I saw a post here yesterday about the classic ""Albus Severus"" line, and some more Snape-hate to go along with it. Whilst I agree the poor child has been given a horrible name, i just wanted to draw attention to Snape's role in this whole thing.  

I think Harry looks back at defeating Voldemort, which is probably the most important thing any wizard ever did, and realises three main components responsible are Himself, Dumbledore and Snape.  

Everyone is aware of the role of the first two, but people forget that Snape's role included being a high risk double agent, spending time with Voldemort (who killed Lily, that must have been tough), and maintaining this role even after his mentor/guide had passed.  

Not only did he conspire to kill Dumbledore and become part of his final plan, he also faked the sword, and presented the real one to the trio, exactly as instructed. He then desperately tryed to track down Harry at the last moment, to the point where he was killed by Voldemort. However, he still managed to pass on the critical information to Harry.  

I think it's easy to think of The Prince's Tale just being some soppy redemption of Snape due to his love for Lily, but the purpose of that chapter (and the purpose of Snape telling Harry), is to get the information to him that he has the Horcrux within himself, and he must sacrifice himself at the last moment.  

I only really appreciated this last night while listening. Snape was a very important piece of that final plan, allowing Dumbledore's plan to continue beyond his death, and using Snape's unique position in the game. Without Snape, it doesn't work out. Just something to consider.  

Granted he's still a dick. But it's not ""a free pass for being obsessed with Lily"".. it's a free pass for ""playing a hugely important role in defeating the most evil dark wizard of all time"".. pretty fair IMO.",2021-03-09 09:58:20,0,discussion,34,0.72,0,1,34,0,53,0,0,0,Tues,1,1,"In Defence of Snape Hello All,

499,m1fyop,Wand Cores," 

Hey everyone! Today I want to talk about wand cores and why I think that Garrick Ollivander's wands are NOT the absolute best and why I feel the characters in Harry Potter only believe so out of bias. And that's where I'm going to start:

Garrick Ollivander is the best wandmaker in the UK, however that does NOT mean he's the best in the world. Why does everyone say he is? Out of cultural bias of course, his family name is famous in the UK and Ireland and he's credited with the creation of the term ""Supreme Wand Cores"", being Dragon heartstring, Unicorn hair and Phoenix feather, which makes him standout from among his fellow wandmakers in the UK, however we see first hand that Viktor Krum when he says: ""I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch wand. They are the best although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander."", this shows that Krum, and likely other people in Eastern Europe feel that Gregorovitch's wands are the best in the world, and I'd bet money that American wizards and witches would say the same about American wandmakers and so on. So why do all the characters we love in Harry Potter say Ollivander is the best? Out of cultural bias, pure and simple. 

Now, I want to address Garrick's ""Supreme Wand Cores"" and why I feel they aren't truly the best or strongest cores. I think he chose these three because they were the most balanced, and would therefor cause the least dissatisfied customers. I feel he chose this method because it was best for business, if the wands are easily tamed, less wizards and witches would come back to his shop with complaints, and thus his reputation would remain in good standing. While this makes sense and IS good business practice, I want to examine a few wands with cores we know to be at least as good as the ""Supreme Cores"", and in many cases, vastly superior. 

\#1: The Elder Wand, this wand has a Thestral tail hair core and as we know, is the most powerful wand in existence. While the rumors of it being made by Death are cute, it's MUCH more likely to have been made by  Antioch Peverell and the power it possesses would seem to indicate that Thestral tail hairs are much more powerful than the ""Three Supreme Cores"". 

\#2: Salazar Slytherin's Wand, this wand had a Basilisk horn core and was crafted by Salazar himself, it was stated by Gormlaith Gaunt, a former wielder of the wand, to have been more powerful than the one she got from Ollivander's which had a Dragon heartstring core. Additionally, this wand could be instructed to ""sleep"" when spoken too in Parseltongue, giving this core strategic advantages to those who could speak it. 

\#3: Fleur Delacour's Wand, this wand had a Veela hair core and was crafted by a French wandmaker, likely for Fleur specifically as the hair came from her grandmother, the use of this core shocked Garrick when examining the wand, who believes that Veela hair wands are too temperamental. We know Fleur is a capable witch and has performed impressive feats of magic with this wand, comparable to anything done with Garrick's own ""Supreme Core"" wands, showing it's at least equal. 

\#4: Webster &amp; Chadwick Boot's Wands, these wands had Horned Serpent horn cores and were stated by Isolt Sayre, who wielded Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk wand, to have been of exceptional power. Chadwick was able to use his wand to duel against Gormlaith Gaunt who was much more powerful than he was and far more experienced to a draw, forcing Gormlaith to complement his power. This is a true testament to the wand's core, which was amplified 10x when used with Webster's wand, which was it's twin. Like the Basilisk core wands, these wands could be spoken too in Parseltongue, instead alerted their owners when they were in danger when they heard the ancient language. 

\#5: Seraphina Picquery's Wand, this wand was crafted by Violetta Beauvais, an American wandmaker, it had a Rougarou hair core. While we haven't seen this wand in action, we know it belonged to the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, and it's unlikely she'd be capable of achieving the power necessary for this position with a wand of low quality. Implying this wand is very powerful, again being at LEAST on par with anything from Garrick. 

Looking at all this info, it would seem safe to believe that the power of a wand core comes directly from how powerful the creature it was taken from, a belief that is further backed up by Garrick's comments on weak cores such as Troll whiskers and Kneazle hair. Since Thunderbirds are relatives to the Phoenix, and equally powerful in their own way, we can assume Thunderbird tail feather cores would be comparably powerful. Nundu mane quills would also likely produce massively powerful wands, since they're said to be even more dangerous than Dragons.

The reasons that I can find are:

510,m14x4n,Anyone else feel very let down by movie Voldemort?,"Voldemort, to me, and I'm sure it was the intent, is the equivalent of Wizard Hitler. Hitler, for all his evil, was incredibly charming, for those of his times, he was likable, even. Before the War, and before the  the Genocides became public, he was even Time's Man of the Year. He was celebrated even in America, by non-Nazis, as Germany's potential hero, who would raise her to greatness again. As we saw, he brought her to utter degradation, degeneracy and ruin. Yet, he was compelling. He spoke eloquently, in a manner that many real life people felt themselves almost bewitched by his speech.  


I say all these things because if you examine how a man as morally repulsive as Hitler could gain so many followers, you can see the qualities necessary for a Wizard like Voldemort to gain so many followers as well. Voldemort, when I read him, is highly intelligent, cold, calculating, menacing, charismatic...Yet as utterly inhuman as any serial killer in any prison. Lacking in feeling, which only added to his menace; we are dealing with someone amazing, who has transcended humanity in both mentality and form - and yet in the process has become grotesque. Someone who could've been truly GREAT - Among the greatest of all time, as Hitler, had he been a good man, could've been one of the great men of history. There is a nuance to Voldemort that makes it plain why one would follow him, if they agreed with his views. 

Movie Voldemort on the other hand comes off a clown. A cartoon villain. A cackling, goofy sort of maniacal metaphorical mustache twirling madman. And yes, book Voldemort is insane, but it is a cold, cruel, empty hollowed out insanity, the insanity of one who has literally experimented too much, who has been shaped by evil into something past humanity, or some very distorted mockery of it. The Voldemort of the movies is almost laughable. How can one be reasonably frightened of someone that is a buffoon? There's nothing remotely likable or scary about him; Movie Voldemort does not sell me as a man who could enslave the minds of so many strong willed people and bend them to his own will. One could argue that Lucius Malfoy, in the films, has a much more menacing presence. Yet, I can't see Malfoy serving movie Voldemort and being able to take him seriously. I can't see Snape doing so in his youth either. On rewatches, movie Voldemort tends to remind me of Count Olaf from the Snickett books; more a pitiable, buffoonish wretch than a true VILLAIN, a true master of evil. Voldemort to me is Dumbledore's dark double - For as noble and as great as Dumbledore is, Voldemort is the ugliest personification of what Dumbledore would be if he dabbled in evil - and should as such carry the same grace, just darkened; the same nobility, just without any warmth; the same eloquence, just without any humanity.

there's my other reviews for the other movies if you're interested back to the movie

&amp;#x200B;

1. **HARRY AND THE DURSLEYS**

The dursleys are horrible we can all agree on that right? I am mainly going to focus on Dudley so our movie starts off fucking horrible. In the books it was harry making fun of Dudley which felt amazing but in the movie for some reason its Dudley and his gang making fun of harry honestly its so dumb why they even cut this out. Harry was tormented by Dudley for like 10 years of his childhood and to have him finally truly stand up to him is such an amazing moment for harry. The movies have this weird obsession of ruining ever character for some reason and harry is ruined hard in this movie. Then we the dementors show up and this annoys me so much, the fact that harry's patronus is not even a fucking stag omfg the movie just started and it already failed this bad. And they forget to say who sent the dementors and cut out the owls being sent which was hilarious in the books. Bad start movie, bad start

2. **NUMBER 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE**

Weirdly enough this is like the 3rd house we see in the entire series. Anyway Grimmauld place is probably one of the best locations in the place because we practically spend so little time their and already know so much about the place, like everyone can remember Mrs Black's screaming portrait or the troll leg umbrella stand that Tonks keeps knocking... oh wait all of this stuff I mentioned is cut out from the film. And who can forget the cleaning, only a series like Harry Potter can make fucking cleaning fun as hell and I can't believe they cut that out too honestly whats wrong with this movie. Now probably my favourite thing that happens in this place is that amazing incredible boggart scene with Molly and harry see's all her children dead and not just her children even a dead harry. That is fucking beautiful and it basically solidifies that harry is an unofficial Weasley and its done in such an amazing way by not just saying that he's one but showing it in a heartbreaking way and I love it for doing that and I hate that they cut this out. They also forgot Ron and Hermione being prefects.

**3. THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC**

I love the fact that this is the first time we actually see the ministry and it makes for an awesome reveal. I don't really get that sense of awe and spectacle in the film mainly due to the fact we don't see all of floors. Like I said with grimmauld place we practically live at the ministry its described so well in the books that it just sticks with you like I can name you like 4 floors at the top of my head rn. But before since I watched the movies first I never really cared about the ministry that much at all and its just skimmed over. We just see the atrium and then BOOM we're already at the hearing but in the books we see so many floors and places that I can't help but love it. Now the actual hearing, the fact this entire hearing was done bcz harry did magic outside of school is lost once you realised that in the movies they do magic outside of school so many times and it just seems comical in the books they bring up the fact that harry ''did'' magic in the chamber of secrets but he says it was dobby and fudge doesn't believe none of it. And Dumbledore ignoring isn't really shown that much yk in the books its made apparent that the entire time Dumbledore didn't even look at him or show any sign that he knew harry even existed but in the movie he just kinda shouts his name quietly and then he just doesn't care afterwards, which is stupid af.

**4. PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE**

Umbridge is horrible, we can all agree on that... BUT, in the movies her actions don't really seem that bad beside the fact that she carved words on harry's hand which is horrible but compared to her actions in the books she's pretty tame actually. She doesn't ban him from quidditch, she doesn't give him multiple detentions, she doesn't put Hagrid on probation and doesn't ban harry from hogsmeade. In the books harry wanted to basically leave Hogwarts, she makes his life hell at Hogwarts. And her appearance is not even close to how she was described in the books. I once showed a picture of how umbridge looked like in the books in a discord chat and everyone was fucking disgusted and I don't think people were disgusted when they saw how she was in the movie no offence to actor she played her fine but its mainly the fact that she's not as despicable as she was in the books. Oh yeah and the quibbler thing with was amazing and I hate the they cut it out and where's Firenze that was funny, the fact that Dumbledore hired a teacher just to annoy umbridge is incredible.

**5. DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY**

The fact that a huge part of this book was just butchered down into into a montage and half a class is horrible. This shit was fun as hell in the books, seeing the kids rebelling against umbridge and the entire ministry is amazing I loved it so much. And neville finding the room of requirement by accident is fucking dumb af and how does Hermione even know about the room in the first place? you siriusly telling me that Hermione knows what this room does and doesn't know where its at, EVEN THOUGH DUMBLEDORE TOLD HARRY LAST YEAR bruh just bruh. Where the coins at? those shit were the best and its used in the later books, Draco using it in book 6 and neville using it to call people in the battle of Hogwarts and its like why cut this out the books came out before the movie came out so its even more stupider. And Dobby, thats all I have to say,

**6. St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries**

*Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.*

*“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .”*

*But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.*

*“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery*

*voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, “Thanks Mum.”*

*His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any- thing less funny in his life.*

Thats all I have to say, They cut out this incredible scene and I will never forgive them for cutting this out.

**7. Snape's Worst Memory**

Damn what an amazning chapter. Occulmency is so much fun like reading I fucking love it so much, its like watching a film reel I in a book, but in the movies it just happens so quickly and fast and they just use it as an excuse to reuse old footage from the other movies for nostalgic purposes, and thats annoying in the books we mostly see stuff we never knew before. Snape in the books was cruel in these lessons and not encouraging enough but in the movies he doesn't really do much. For example when harry see's his memory, in the books he throws a jar of dead crockroaches, in the movie Snape just tells him to get out. Now the actual scene in fucking stupid in the movies, thats not even what protego does and the pensive isn't even fucking there, its so fascinating to see what Hogwarts was like back then and see what the marauders were like but in the film we just see them hanging Snape and thats it. There's a deleted scene not really scene, which shows lily with them but for some reason they cut it out. They forget the most important part, there's a reason this is called Snape's worst memory he called his best friend a mud blood and regretted his entire life. 

**8. O.W.L.s**

Oh my god. The movie mentions this and tell us how important this is, AND THE DON'T EVEN SHOW IT.  Even in the HBP movie mcgonnagoll mentions that harry wants to become an auror BUT HE NEVER EVEN HAD HIS CARRER ADVICE WTF. And now the actual exams, only a series like Harry Potter could make exams fun. Its weird to say but I love reading the exams and all the kids being stressed and its so fascinating to see how wizards do their exams, But the movies just doesn't really care about Hogwarts being a school. Look how many classes are in these movies, Barely any. And where tf is Hagrid hulk smashing umbridge and her ministry cronies? that shit was phenomenal I loved that so much and then mcgonnagoll gets four stunning spells to the chest, and they cut it all out. Istg this movie is falling apart, OOTP isn't even my favourite book in the series, but it has some of the best scenes in the series. When harry passes out from seeing the false memory why... WHY is it that Hermione is the who comes to him? Why Hermione only wtf. These movies ship Hermione and harry so much I can't even, thats a story for another day. Now all of the shit I just said, Has nothing compared to whats next. 

**9. THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES** 

This. This right here is the biggest reason I hate and despise this fucking movie. This movie ruined the best fight scene in all of Harry Potter and I will not stand for it. Before I get into the fight I wanna talk about something else, Kreacher. Why does harry or anyone else get the fucking idea to contact Kreacher. He's in grimmauld place and they did it in the books, And the fact that he betrayed Sirius is heartbreaking and the worst part is, he told all of this to Dumbledore while laughing. And why is harry like ''I'm doing this alone bye bye'' right before they were about to leave? JUST LEAVE UMRBIDGE ISN'T HERE YOU'RE BASICALLY GIVING HER TIME TO CATCH YOU BOZOS! okay lets just get into the actual fight. They go into the ministry go to level 9 (see what I did there? ;D) and here's where the problems lie. Where the actual Frick is the entrance to the department of mysteries? the entrance itself was part of the place and its not even there wtf, they just walk into a lift and boom they're in the prophecy room. Now here is where my problems lie, IMO this is the greatest fight scene in all of HP. Usually in fights its basically like just duels like 2 homeboys using expelliarmus or something and that is Kinda annoying. The spells can be the same but the place doesn't need to be, having this fight in the department makes it so anything can fucking happen, because the logic allows for it. You wanna have a jar of brains that strangle you? fuck it go ahead. The department is full so much weirdo shit and I fucking love that, this fight scene is what makes this book a masterpiece. now lets look at the movie... OMFG THEY JUST FUCKING CUT OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE FUCKING ROOMS! WTF MOVIE YOU HAD ONE JOB IDFC WHAT EXCUSE THEY HAD IF THEY COULDN'T DO IT RIGHT THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT AT ALL! YOU CUT OUT THE BRAINS, THE TIME ROOM, THE SPACE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, THE WEIRDO ROOM THAT NOBODY CAN OPEN. BUT YOU KEEP THE PROPHECY ROOM AND THE DEATH CHAMBER? WHY! YOU COULD'VE MADE ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTS IN ALL OF HP HISTORY BUT NO! YOU JUST HAD TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING DIDN'T YOU! NOW LETS GET INTO THE ACTUAL FIGHT. IN THE BOOKS THERE'S A FUCKING BABY HEADED DEATH EATER WALKING AROUND, DOLOHOV USES SOME KIND OF PURPLE FLAME THINGY, HERMIONE SILENCES THIS DUDE, NEVILLE GET HIS NOSE BROKEN AND JABS HIS WAND INTO DEATH EATER'S EYES, RON GETS STRANGLED BY BRAINS! HOW COOL DOES THAT SOUND THE MOVIE JUST FUCKING CUT OUT EVERYTHING THAT I JUST SAID. ITS STUPID, ITS A DISGRACE, ITS HORRIBLE! LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOI LOOK! THATS JUST THE FIGHT ITSELF LETS TALK ABOUT THE REASON EVERYONE IS EVEN FUCKING THERE! THE PROPHECY! THEY MAKE HARRY HEAR THE DAMN PROPHECY BEFORE HE GOES INTO DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE WHAT THE FUCK! IN THE BOOKS IT GETS DESTROYED BY NEVILLE'S DANCING LEGS WHICH IS HILARIOUS! NEVILLE BROKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM HIS LEGS LMFAO. BUT IN THE MOVIES SIRIUS JUST PUNCHES LUCIUS AND DROPS THE DAMN THING BRUH! NOW LETS TALK ABOUT SIRIUS'S DEATH WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! THE FACT THAT HE JUST FALLS THROUGH THE VEIL IS HEARTBREAKING AND HARRY THINKING HE WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE, BUT LUPIN TELLS HIM THE TRUTH, HE ISN'T COMING BACK AND HE NEVER DOES. HARRY KEEPS SHOUTING SIRIUS AT THE VEIL THINKING HIS GODFATHER WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE SMILING AT HIM BUT NO, HE DOESN'T COME BACK. THE MOVIE SAYS FUCK THAT SHIT AND HAS HIM DIE FROM THE AVADA KEDAVRA SO THE VEIL DIDN'T KILL HIM IN THE MOVIES IT WAS THE KILLING CURSE WTF AND HARRY SEE GET HIT BY IT SO WHY WOULD HE THINK HE'LL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE? OH YEAH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T THINK THAT! THIS MOVIE TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE OOTP SO AMAZING AND UNIQUE AND JUST THREW IT OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW. WHY IS IT THAT IN THE MOVIE ITS BELLATRIX TAUNTING HARRY BUT IN THE BOOKS ITS HARRY TAUNTING BELLATRIX TO THE POINT WHERE SHE'S ACTUALLY SCARED WTF!. DUMBLEDORE VS VOLDEMORT SUCKED I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, WHEN VOLDEMORT POSSESSED HARRY IT WAS PAIN BEYOND ANYTHING HE HAD EVER IMAGINED AND HE WANTED TO DIE! HE WANTED TO FUCKING DIE! AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE FACT THAT HE WILL SEE SIRIUS WHEN HE DIED! HIS GRIEF OVERCAME VOLDEMORTS POWER AND THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. IN THE MOVIE HOWEVER YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT IT WAS? OH YEAH HIS FRIENDS! THAT IS THE MOST CHEEZY SHIT EVER HIS FRIENDS AIN'T GUNNA DO SHIT THEY JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH LIKE THIS IS SOME TV SHOW EPISODE OR SOMETING AND HE FUCKING THINKS ABOUT HIS FRIENDS RATHER THEN SEEING HIS DEAD GODFATHER WHEN HE DIED. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HE SAYS TO VOLDEMORT? ''I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU'' OMFG THAT IS THE STUPID SHIT EVER! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT Harry Potter? THE BOY WHO SUFFERED SO MANY TIMES BY VOLDEMORT WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HE DID?

Goblet of fire movie did remove alot of stuff from the book which annoyed me to death but whats worse is the fact that this movie ruined stuff from the books which imo is worse and I despise it for it there's alot of reasons why I hate this one but I can never put it all in one post so I am going to go over the major flaws and that explains why my score for this movie is very low

there's my other reviews for the other movies if you're interested back to the movie

&amp;#x200B;

1. **HARRY AND THE DURSLEYS**

The dursleys are horrible we can all agree on that right? I am mainly going to focus on Dudley so our movie starts off fucking horrible. In the books it was harry making fun of Dudley which felt amazing but in the movie for some reason its Dudley and his gang making fun of harry honestly its so dumb why they even cut this out. Harry was tormented by Dudley for like 10 years of his childhood and to have him finally truly stand up to him is such an amazing moment for harry. The movies have this weird obsession of ruining ever character for some reason and harry is ruined hard in this movie. Then we the dementors show up and this annoys me so much, the fact that harry's patronus is not even a fucking stag omfg the movie just started and it already failed this bad. And they forget to say who sent the dementors and cut out the owls being sent which was hilarious in the books. Bad start movie, bad start

2. **NUMBER 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE**

Weirdly enough this is like the 3rd house we see in the entire series. Anyway Grimmauld place is probably one of the best locations in the place because we practically spend so little time their and already know so much about the place, like everyone can remember Mrs Black's screaming portrait or the troll leg umbrella stand that Tonks keeps knocking... oh wait all of this stuff I mentioned is cut out from the film. And who can forget the cleaning, only a series like Harry Potter can make fucking cleaning fun as hell and I can't believe they cut that out too honestly whats wrong with this movie. Now probably my favourite thing that happens in this place is that amazing incredible boggart scene with Molly and harry see's all her children dead and not just her children even a dead harry. That is fucking beautiful and it basically solidifies that harry is an unofficial Weasley and its done in such an amazing way by not just saying that he's one but showing it in a heartbreaking way and I love it for doing that and I hate that they cut this out. They also forgot Ron and Hermione being prefects.

**3. THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC**

I love the fact that this is the first time we actually see the ministry and it makes for an awesome reveal. I don't really get that sense of awe and spectacle in the film mainly due to the fact we don't see all of floors. Like I said with grimmauld place we practically live at the ministry its described so well in the books that it just sticks with you like I can name you like 4 floors at the top of my head rn. But before since I watched the movies first I never really cared about the ministry that much at all and its just skimmed over. We just see the atrium and then BOOM we're already at the hearing but in the books we see so many floors and places that I can't help but love it. Now the actual hearing, the fact this entire hearing was done bcz harry did magic outside of school is lost once you realised that in the movies they do magic outside of school so many times and it just seems comical in the books they bring up the fact that harry ''did'' magic in the chamber of secrets but he says it was dobby and fudge doesn't believe none of it. And Dumbledore ignoring isn't really shown that much yk in the books its made apparent that the entire time Dumbledore didn't even look at him or show any sign that he knew harry even existed but in the movie he just kinda shouts his name quietly and then he just doesn't care afterwards, which is stupid af.

**4. PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE**

Umbridge is horrible, we can all agree on that... BUT, in the movies her actions don't really seem that bad beside the fact that she carved words on harry's hand which is horrible but compared to her actions in the books she's pretty tame actually. She doesn't ban him from quidditch, she doesn't give him multiple detentions, she doesn't put Hagrid on probation and doesn't ban harry from hogsmeade. In the books harry wanted to basically leave Hogwarts, she makes his life hell at Hogwarts. And her appearance is not even close to how she was described in the books. I once showed a picture of how umbridge looked like in the books in a discord chat and everyone was fucking disgusted and I don't think people were disgusted when they saw how she was in the movie no offence to actor she played her fine but its mainly the fact that she's not as despicable as she was in the books. Oh yeah and the quibbler thing with was amazing and I hate the they cut it out and where's Firenze that was funny, the fact that Dumbledore hired a teacher just to annoy umbridge is incredible.

**5. DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY**

The fact that a huge part of this book was just butchered down into into a montage and half a class is horrible. This shit was fun as hell in the books, seeing the kids rebelling against umbridge and the entire ministry is amazing I loved it so much. And neville finding the room of requirement by accident is fucking dumb af and how does Hermione even know about the room in the first place? you siriusly telling me that Hermione knows what this room does and doesn't know where its at, EVEN THOUGH DUMBLEDORE TOLD HARRY LAST YEAR bruh just bruh. Where the coins at? those shit were the best and its used in the later books, Draco using it in book 6 and neville using it to call people in the battle of Hogwarts and its like why cut this out the books came out before the movie came out so its even more stupider. And Dobby, thats all I have to say,

**6. St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries**

*Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.*

*“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .”*

*But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.*

*“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery*

*voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, “Thanks Mum.”*

*His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any- thing less funny in his life.*

Thats all I have to say, They cut out this incredible scene and I will never forgive them for cutting this out.

**7. Snape's Worst Memory**

Damn what an amazning chapter. Occulmency is so much fun like reading I fucking love it so much, its like watching a film reel I in a book, but in the movies it just happens so quickly and fast and they just use it as an excuse to reuse old footage from the other movies for nostalgic purposes, and thats annoying in the books we mostly see stuff we never knew before. Snape in the books was cruel in these lessons and not encouraging enough but in the movies he doesn't really do much. For example when harry see's his memory, in the books he throws a jar of dead crockroaches, in the movie Snape just tells him to get out. Now the actual scene in fucking stupid in the movies, thats not even what protego does and the pensive isn't even fucking there, its so fascinating to see what Hogwarts was like back then and see what the marauders were like but in the film we just see them hanging Snape and thats it. There's a deleted scene not really scene, which shows lily with them but for some reason they cut it out. They forget the most important part, there's a reason this is called Snape's worst memory he called his best friend a mud blood and regretted his entire life. 

**8. O.W.L.s**

Oh my god. The movie mentions this and tell us how important this is, AND THE DON'T EVEN SHOW IT.  Even in the HBP movie mcgonnagoll mentions that harry wants to become an auror BUT HE NEVER EVEN HAD HIS CARRER ADVICE WTF. And now the actual exams, only a series like Harry Potter could make exams fun. Its weird to say but I love reading the exams and all the kids being stressed and its so fascinating to see how wizards do their exams, But the movies just doesn't really care about Hogwarts being a school. Look how many classes are in these movies, Barely any. And where tf is Hagrid hulk smashing umbridge and her ministry cronies? that shit was phenomenal I loved that so much and then mcgonnagoll gets four stunning spells to the chest, and they cut it all out. Istg this movie is falling apart, OOTP isn't even my favourite book in the series, but it has some of the best scenes in the series. When harry passes out from seeing the false memory why... WHY is it that Hermione is the who comes to him? Why Hermione only wtf. These movies ship Hermione and harry so much I can't even, thats a story for another day. Now all of the shit I just said, Has nothing compared to whats next. 

**9. THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES** 

This. This right here is the biggest reason I hate and despise this fucking movie. This movie ruined the best fight scene in all of Harry Potter and I will not stand for it. Before I get into the fight I wanna talk about something else, Kreacher. Why does harry or anyone else get the fucking idea to contact Kreacher. He's in grimmauld place and they did it in the books, And the fact that he betrayed Sirius is heartbreaking and the worst part is, he told all of this to Dumbledore while laughing. And why is harry like ''I'm doing this alone bye bye'' right before they were about to leave? JUST LEAVE UMRBIDGE ISN'T HERE YOU'RE BASICALLY GIVING HER TIME TO CATCH YOU BOZOS! okay lets just get into the actual fight. They go into the ministry go to level 9 (see what I did there? ;D) and here's where the problems lie. Where the actual Frick is the entrance to the department of mysteries? the entrance itself was part of the place and its not even there wtf, they just walk into a lift and boom they're in the prophecy room. Now here is where my problems lie, IMO this is the greatest fight scene in all of HP. Usually in fights its basically like just duels like 2 homeboys using expelliarmus or something and that is Kinda annoying. The spells can be the same but the place doesn't need to be, having this fight in the department makes it so anything can fucking happen, because the logic allows for it. You wanna have a jar of brains that strangle you? fuck it go ahead. The department is full so much weirdo shit and I fucking love that, this fight scene is what makes this book a masterpiece. now lets look at the movie... OMFG THEY JUST FUCKING CUT OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE FUCKING ROOMS! WTF MOVIE YOU HAD ONE JOB IDFC WHAT EXCUSE THEY HAD IF THEY COULDN'T DO IT RIGHT THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT AT ALL! YOU CUT OUT THE BRAINS, THE TIME ROOM, THE SPACE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, THE WEIRDO ROOM THAT NOBODY CAN OPEN. BUT YOU KEEP THE PROPHECY ROOM AND THE DEATH CHAMBER? WHY! YOU COULD'VE MADE ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTS IN ALL OF HP HISTORY BUT NO! YOU JUST HAD TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING DIDN'T YOU! NOW LETS GET INTO THE ACTUAL FIGHT. IN THE BOOKS THERE'S A FUCKING BABY HEADED DEATH EATER WALKING AROUND, DOLOHOV USES SOME KIND OF PURPLE FLAME THINGY, HERMIONE SILENCES THIS DUDE, NEVILLE GET HIS NOSE BROKEN AND JABS HIS WAND INTO DEATH EATER'S EYES, RON GETS STRANGLED BY BRAINS! HOW COOL DOES THAT SOUND THE MOVIE JUST FUCKING CUT OUT EVERYTHING THAT I JUST SAID. ITS STUPID, ITS A DISGRACE, ITS HORRIBLE! LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOI LOOK! THATS JUST THE FIGHT ITSELF LETS TALK ABOUT THE REASON EVERYONE IS EVEN FUCKING THERE! THE PROPHECY! THEY MAKE HARRY HEAR THE DAMN PROPHECY BEFORE HE GOES INTO DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE WHAT THE FUCK! IN THE BOOKS IT GETS DESTROYED BY NEVILLE'S DANCING LEGS WHICH IS HILARIOUS! NEVILLE BROKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM HIS LEGS LMFAO. BUT IN THE MOVIES SIRIUS JUST PUNCHES LUCIUS AND DROPS THE DAMN THING BRUH! NOW LETS TALK ABOUT SIRIUS'S DEATH WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! THE FACT THAT HE JUST FALLS THROUGH THE VEIL IS HEARTBREAKING AND HARRY THINKING HE WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE, BUT LUPIN TELLS HIM THE TRUTH, HE ISN'T COMING BACK AND HE NEVER DOES. HARRY KEEPS SHOUTING SIRIUS AT THE VEIL THINKING HIS GODFATHER WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE SMILING AT HIM BUT NO, HE DOESN'T COME BACK. THE MOVIE SAYS FUCK THAT SHIT AND HAS HIM DIE FROM THE AVADA KEDAVRA SO THE VEIL DIDN'T KILL HIM IN THE MOVIES IT WAS THE KILLING CURSE WTF AND HARRY SEE GET HIT BY IT SO WHY WOULD HE THINK HE'LL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE? OH YEAH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T THINK THAT! THIS MOVIE TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE OOTP SO AMAZING AND UNIQUE AND JUST THREW IT OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW. WHY IS IT THAT IN THE MOVIE ITS BELLATRIX TAUNTING HARRY BUT IN THE BOOKS ITS HARRY TAUNTING BELLATRIX TO THE POINT WHERE SHE'S ACTUALLY SCARED WTF!. DUMBLEDORE VS VOLDEMORT SUCKED I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, WHEN VOLDEMORT POSSESSED HARRY IT WAS PAIN BEYOND ANYTHING HE HAD EVER IMAGINED AND HE WANTED TO DIE! HE WANTED TO FUCKING DIE! AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE FACT THAT HE WILL SEE SIRIUS WHEN HE DIED! HIS GRIEF OVERCAME VOLDEMORTS POWER AND THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. IN THE MOVIE HOWEVER YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT IT WAS? OH YEAH HIS FRIENDS! THAT IS THE MOST CHEEZY SHIT EVER HIS FRIENDS AIN'T GUNNA DO SHIT THEY JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH LIKE THIS IS SOME TV SHOW EPISODE OR SOMETING AND HE FUCKING THINKS ABOUT HIS FRIENDS RATHER THEN SEEING HIS DEAD GODFATHER WHEN HE DIED. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HE SAYS TO VOLDEMORT? ''I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU'' OMFG THAT IS THE STUPID SHIT EVER! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT Harry Potter? THE BOY WHO SUFFERED SO MANY TIMES BY VOLDEMORT WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HE DID? AFTER ALL THE PEOPLE HE LOVED THAT HE KILLED AND HIS DEATH EATERS KILLED DO YOU REALLY FUCKING THINK HARRY WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? FUCK NO OFC NOT THIS MOVIE IS LOSING BRAINCELLS BY THE MINUTE THIS BASICALLY SOLIDIFIES THIS AS THE WORST Harry Potter MOVIE EVER MADE I HATE THIS FUCKING SHIT SO MUCH AND WHAT WHERE THE FUCK IS SIRIUS'S MIRROR? WHERE'S HARRY TALKING TO NEARLY HEADLESS NICK? WHERE'S DUMBLEDORE TELLING HARRY EVERYTHING? WTF THIS MOVIE IS A DISASTER.

522,m0rjvs,My friends and I like to brainstorm ideas for movies within the Harry Potter universe for fun. Here are some of my favorite:,"\- ""Light Drama"" based around the founding and founders of Hogwarts. The rift between Slytherin and the others would be the main point of conflict.

\- The Marauders, Lilly, Snape, etc at Hogwarts.

\- The formation of the Order and the first fight against Voldemort

\-Set right after the fall of Voldemort, a crime/detective movie with Mad-Eye as the main character. Set around him tracking down/prosecuting old Death Eaters.

\-A ""comeback kids"" sports movie about a struggling Quidditch club that comes out of nowhere to win the league. Chudley Cannons would be a fun team to base it on. Ron's favorite and a team that has been known to struggle

\-Since we don't see or hear about him much, a movie based on Charlie Weasley's adventures in Romania. Would be cool to see different kinds of dragons. Thought it could be set in the summer time and have Hagrid join him/help him for the break. That way the fans can still see a beloved character in this new setting/story.

\-After JK released the names and locations of the different wizarding schools, would be cool to see a movie set in one of the ""foreign"" schools.

\-This one is a stretch haha: Based on Bill Weasley, a financial/Wall Street type thriller about the relationship between goblins and wizards.

523,m1eabf,Opinions on the house system and alternatives,"For a long time, I've been of the belief that the house system in Harry Potter is a really bad idea. Imagine you're going into sixth grade. Before you can start classes, your teacher tells you you have to be in a category that are essentially boiled down to good, evil, friendly, and smart. And you don't even get to decide! A hundred-year-old piece of headware that introduces itself through song is going to decide what box you fit in for the next seven years. That wouldn't fly, right?

I think it would've been a lot more interesting if the houses were academic courses. For example, Ravenclaws get advanced classes and much more in-depth coursework. Slytherins can choose electives and drop core classes earlier than the other houses in order to pursue their ambition. I'm not sure about Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs, but maybe Hufflepuffs have less coursework in favor of getting involved in the community (joining clubs, quidditch, volunteer work, etc.) and Gryffindors have a DADA/Auror/curse-breaking focus. For the first year, students don't have a house and are able to get to know each other without house lines dividing them. At the end of the year they decide on a house depending on what they want to get out of their Hogwarts experience.

It just always rubbed me the wrong way the way the house system functioned. Imagine you get sorted into Slytherin after hearing your whole life that they're the evil house and that only dark wizards are sorted there? That would be devastating to an eleven-year-old.

549,m0y06u,"What Harry Potter meant to me, a person definitely not in Rowling's target demographic.","I suppose this might be long, as I am prone to rambling occasionally. I just wanted to warn everyone ahead of time.

I am definitely out of the age bracket for an ordinary first-time Harry Potter reader. I was 24 when the first book was released.
I had a stepson who was a little too young for Harry Potter at the time. By the time he was old enough, he had other interests. I knew for certain that this was something I would have obsessed over had it come out when I was young. Fast forward to 2018. I don't know why, but I decided that this was as good a time as any to step into the world of Hogwarts. I listened to all the books on Audible during my commute to and from work. It was, no pun intended, magical. I would get a light feeling in my stomach and I couldn't wait to hear what was next. When I was about 10 years old, my mother and I were at a yard sale and I found a box full of old D&amp;D books. I bought them and was hooked instantly. That was the last time I felt as giddy as I did by listening to the Harry Potter books. 

Over time, both real-time and book time, something changed. These precocious children were getting older, and I noticed that my patience for them was thinning. I'm certain that had I started the books as a young man, then I would have felt differently. I was not reading them as a young man, though. I was reading them as an adult with a family of my own. The fact of the matter is, as the children got older, I grew less fond of them. Here they were, wizards and witches, living in a world of wonder, and all they seemed to do was whine and complain.

I listened to all the books even though as they went on it felt more like a chore than a pleasure. I was hoping for an incredible rush of emotion at the end, but that didn't happen for me. I felt that the pacing was rushed later in the story, and perhaps Rowling was just trying to finish the thing and put it behind her. It was a shame because the early books were so amazing.

Now here we are today. I still look in on what is happening in the online world of Harry Potter. I like to see what people are thinking and reading all the fan theories. I still enjoy Harry Potter, in fact, I am watching the first movie as I type this. I still have only seen the first two movies. I still get a little tingle in my belly thinking about how I felt reading the first few books. I even ordered a custom wand and everything.

551,m0gglg,I'm surprised at the level of derision lobbed at the Epilogue,"I've just completed a reread of *The Deathly Hallows* (actually, of the whole series); the first time since it first came out in 2007. At the time, I had no strong reactions to the Epilogue, but the poor recreation in the film adaptation and the general tone of discussions about it had led to think of it as a particularly shoddy piece of writing.

I was pleasantly surprised then that it's well... *fine*, and far from the weakest writing in this novel in particular\*. I tried reading some articles and prior discussions on this subreddit, and from what I gather, some of the themes of the complaints revolve around the fact that it's a lightweight piece of fluff, and the names Harry picked out for his kids.

As an addendum to the story, however, I feel like the entire point of the chapter's existence is to hammer home the fact that peace and tranquility has been restored to the world our characters inhabit. Its very mundanity is the key to its existence; after the final confrontation and its immediate aftermath, Rowling seemed to want to emphasize what it was all for: so children can see their kids off to school, and for those kids to be able joke around, tease each other, and not have to worry about anything other than learning and enjoying themselves. For Harry as a character, it's the easygoing existence he was always denied, and for us as readers, it's a return to the relatively lighthearted tone of the first novels - the excitement that accompanied a step into a world filled with wonder, but not necessarily danger.

As for the names of the kids, to be honest, the worst thing I can point out about them is their predictability, and that's only because it's so appropriate. *Of course* Harry named two of them after his dead parents; if he didn't, Rowling would've had to work to justify it, and that wasn't the point of the chapter. As for Albus Severus, he of the green eyes and more sensitive temperament, it's all the more meaningful. A running arc throughout *Deathly Hallows* is Harry reconciling his view of Dumbledore and how much the latter had shaped his, Harry's, life with the reality of his actions and history. The chapter ""King's Cross"" is devoted almost entirely to resolving this lingering tension: Harry learns the truth about his mentor, comes to understand the circumstances and motivations behind the choices he made, including the ugly ones. Ultimately, Harry accepts that whatever and whoever Dumbledore was, he helped shape Harry into the man he had become, a man Dumbledore himself considered greater than he. Learning about Snape was similar, in that Harry was confronted with the realization that his own judgment of Snape's character was misinformed and made without an understanding of key factors that drove Snape's actions and decision-making. Though both flawed human beings (and yes, Snape moreso than Dumbledore), they ultimately rose over those flaws (unlike Voldemort, who could never master his own vanity and power-lust) and died as heroes. It makes perfect sense that the spotlighted son would be named after these two characters specifically, at the end of this particular book especially.

565,m17h73,Daniel Radcliffe’s Acting,"I don’t think it’s really all that good. I just finished rewatching the entire Harry Potter series as a refresher on an opinion I had years ago about Radcliffe’s acting. Obviously, in the first few films he is still a child; developing and learning how to hone his acting abilities. That is excusable and justifiable. However, in even the very last film, Deathly Hallows part 2, there are moments on screen where his delivery is so bland and boring that I wonder why the producers just let it in. For example, at the very end when Harry is explaining who the Elder Wand truly belongs to, Ron says, “so that means...” and Harry replies with such a drool response of, “it’s mine.” He shakes the wand like it’s a toy, purses his lips and matter-a-factly gives his line. It’s terrible acting. The other major league actors in the series have a way of displacing Radcliffe for me, and completely outshining him. Even those who were not well know before the movies, like Emma Watson or Rupert Grint did such a better job then Radcliffe. Look at Luna Lovegood, that is such a personality and requires some decent acting to bring all of her quirks out. Evanna Lynch did such a phenomenal job as Luna.

It's only the third movie/book, so Harry or Hermione wouldn't have brought them up in any conversations yet, nor has he been out in the Muggle world compared to later books, where he would've seen someone use them? Nor do they have TVs where he could've watched it in a movie or something

The scene where the Umbridge figurine is forced to cross a tightrope on a unicycle.

571,m0q860,Timing of Lupin's transformation in Prisoner of Azkaban,"Any explanations for the below? Maybe I am nitpicking the plot too much.

1. In the books, it is implied that the werewolf transforms whether they are exposed to the moon or not.

If it was about werewolves being exposed to the moon, Lupin could have just stayed in his office and never transformed. The paragraph in the book discusses the clouds shifting and the moon coming out and then Lupin transforming. 

2. When Lupin describes the wolfsbane potion, he says if he takes it the entire week preceding the full moon, he keeps his mind when he transforms. So even if he did not take it that night, he should have still been in control and transformation should have been bearable by the books own rules. 

3. Snape (under the invisibility cloak) hears Lupin explain how Sirius was an animagus at the SS. But later in the series, when Dumbledore finally reveals the big dog is Sirius, Snape acts as if he dint know...i mean its pretty clear he dint know. He doesnt mention this even after Sirius escapes.

577,m0vygz,The Dursleys Kept Harry Locked in the Cupboard for Twelve Months Straight,"I was re-reading book one, and something jumped out at me. The beginning of chapter three said that the zoo incident had earned Harry his longest ever confinement to the cupboard, and that by the time he was let out, the summer holidays had already begun. But Dudley’s birthday is *in* summer. Harry’s birthday is in July, and Petunia said in book six that Harry is a month younger than Dudley. So Dudley’s birthday is in June. 

Just think about that. They kept him locked in the cupboard for a *whole year.* For comparison, Harry only got a week in the cupboard for growing his hair too fast. Just think about spending a solid year in a cupboard. No social interaction, no exercise, no showers, no sunlight, no visits to the doctor or dentist, no school, no opportunity to do so much as stretch your legs.....that’s completely insane. It’s the sort of thing that would fuck a child up for *years.* Being in such a tiny space for so long, having to stoop your back and being unable to stretch your legs would *definitely* cause physical disfigurement and severe muscle loss. Just imagine spending a *whole year* alone in a dark, cramped cupboard. That’s literally torture.

To be fair, the date of Dudley’s birthday wasn’t revealed until book six, and there were no hints in book one that this was taking place during the summer. So maybe we were meant to assume that it was a month or so. But, going strictly by canon, Harry spent an entire year in the cupboard.

603,m0j3ra,Muggle-born pros and cons,"I am here to list the pros and cons of being muggle-born.  


Pros

1. No annoying siblings at Hogwarts
2. (In accordance to 1)  You are a witch/wizard and your siblings are not #getRektSiblings
3. Eventually will have an understanding of both the wizarding and muggle communities
4. Amaze people with simple sleight of hand muggle magic tricks
5. Having a basic knowledge of science and mathematics 
6. Great songs
7. A technological understanding
8. You can survive without magic
9. It's all real.

These pros are mainly base around understanding things that wizards do not which is an excellent skill for many things such as, blending in with muggles. A wizard wouldn't expect you to be walking around with a phone in your hand and calling someone. These muggle skills are valuable and make you a more able person.   


Cons

1. Very small chance of Slytherin, if that is your house
2. Discrimination
3. Being like WTF at everything in the wizarding world. (ex: WTF is a dementor)
4. Not knowing any wizard friends
5. No technology at Hogwarts
6. Wizards don't know of anything you like (wizard: Why are the stars having wars???)
7. Can't read people's genius theories on reddit
8. Having to leave your pets. You might have a cat but it's ""The Family's""
9. Going into a state of dream-like shock upon figuring out one of your dreams came true.

These cons are based more upon not knowing, opposite the pros. I do believe that most of these cons are bearable in exchange for being a witch or a wizard, except for no. 1. I do think that there is a way around this. Hypothetically, in the muggle-born position, wishing to be in Slytherin is very ambitious, which is a trait of Slytherin, so the Sorting Hat would likely put one in Slytherin.

604,m0tb0c,I need an idea for a tattoo,"Hi! (I’m from Spain, sorry for any errors)
I’ve been a fan of the Harry Potter saga since I was a child and I want to get a tattoo but I can’t figure out what exactly I want to get. 
My favourite characters are the Weasley Twins and Draco Malfoy and I want to get a tattoo combining both but I don’t like realism style. 
At first I was thinking of doing 2 snakes. 2 because of the Twins and a snake representing Draco.. but I want to add details in each snake to be a little more interesting and to make more sense, like footsteps, patronus, or a wand but really, I don’t know.
I’m not going to ask for a drawing because it’s not your job, I just want help, an idea to clear up my mind.
I don’t have friends that like Harry Potter and they can’t advise me, that’s why I’m asking the internet, I just don’t know how to combine “good” and “evil”
I want another point of view and advise from someone that likes Harry Potter and could give me a good idea for a tattoo. 
If you have any other idea it would be awesome to have your opinion.

So now I wonder if he wasn’t wearing it, did he have hair or was he bald? When Voldemort entered his body did all his hair fall out or did he shave his head to prep for his possession?

626,m0agvk,Anyone else have nightmares over the GOF graveyard scene as a kid?,"I still can’t get over the shock of the graveyard scene and the aftermath. 

I remember the first time I saw GOF I was a kid and of course I was watching it because it was Harry Potter and the visuals were cool, because I was a kid without the capacity to look at the deeper story line. 

The creepy rat looking dude from the last movie emerges from the gloom, and then all of a sudden, BAM, Cedric’s motionless on the ground and Harry’s getting choked by a statue’s sickle. And then I see the rat looking dude approach Harry and draw out a dagger and cut Harry’s arm open and the blood dripping from it. I bury my head in a pillow until the entire scene is over. Then I hear the Hogwarts music and Harry’s laying over motionless Cedric - why isn’t Cedric moving? And then it dawns on me like it dawns on the rest of the crowd - he’s dead. And then we see Harry’s arm cut in brighter lighting, and for some reason I thought he was close to death so I turned off the DVD player and put the movie away. 

I had nightmares about that scene for a few weeks and it was only when the Half Blood Prince came out (OOTP was already out, I just didn’t know about it), that I finally realized he didn’t die and was okay, so that got me comfortable with HP again.

I mean even now it still hits. I wince when I see his arm getting cut and it gives me chills when I see Cedric’s dead body laying there when Harry brings him back - the music playing and just how DEAD he looks. Like Cedric died at 17, I’ve made it past 17, and it chills me to think that if I were in his shoes in that universe it could’ve been me laying in that position. And then people’s reactions as the horror sets in... goddamn that’s messed up.

655,m09y81,"Independent bookshop is selling rare Harry Potter first editions for a combined £107,500","  

Hi All, 

I saw this and wanted to share it.

I could not post the link or the amazing back cover, which some of you may have seen already. What struck me were the recommendations from people and I no longer really know, and how the books have dwarfed those recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the main article-(from yahoo UK news)

A bookshop is offering two rare Harry Potter first editions for sale — for a whopping £107,500.

The books — an original paperback edition and hardback version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone — are believed to be the only two on sale in the whole of the country, with the only other paperback available in the United States.

They are now being sold by St Mary's Books in Stamford, Lincolnshire who are hoping to fetch a six-figure sum for the rare finds.

While the first edition paperback, released in 1997, was once available for £4.99 it is on sale for £12,500.

The hardback edition released at the same time, with only 500 copies printed, has a £95,000 price tag — working out at £426 per page.

Shop owner Marcus Tyers, 40, from Stamford, said: “The hardback is extremely rare and is the sort of book that could have been sitting in your bookcase for a long time.

“The paperback is an interesting one in that it's from the exact same sheets and pages as the hardback as they were printed at the same time.

“The only difference is the hardback was printed 500 times whereas the softback was published 5,000 times.""",2021-03-08 06:49:14,0,news,4,1.0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,Mon,0,1,"Independent bookshop is selling rare Harry Potter first editions for a combined £107,500

I bought a replica before I realised this and I feel cheated because every wand is supposed to be unique. I would like a wand that truly pertains to ME, my personality, my character etc. If anyone can help me get a wand that looks unique, but still Harry Potter-esque, and actually pertains to ME, I would be extremely grateful! Thank you!

\*\*\*

Hi, I’m Dakky.

I recently logged onto the Wizarding World website (originally Pottermore, I believe) and I got sorted into my house, found out my wand and discovered my Patronus.

Sorted into Ravenclaw: perfect. I know I’m smack-bang in the middle of Ravenclaw and Slytherin, but I believe I pertain to Ravenclaw more effectively, so I’m happy with that choice.

Patronus was a hedgehog: was a bit underwhelming (especially considering I have friends who have been assigned Hippogriffs before…) but, upon thinking about it, I do feel quite like a hedgehog, I suppose. I’m a little harsh on the outside but kind on the inside. I’m also small, if that has anything to do with it (which it probably doesn’t in the wizarding world, but who knows…)

But then there was the wand. Now, the wand thing really pees me off. Not because I have anything against a 10” Chestnut hard wand with a Unicorn hair core – but because there are ONLY. THREE. IMAGES. OF. WANDS.

When I found out this piece of information, I was like… are you JOKING me? Because I was extremely excited about my Wizarding World/Pottermore wand, so I bought a replica online. It basically feels like I’ve been cheated, because it’s not *truly* what my wand would have looked like, is it? Especially considering Ollivander said that no two wands are the same.

Of course, he didn’t just mean visually, he also meant internally and temperamentally – but the look of the wand can’t just be disregarded when he stated that no two wands are the same, otherwise how would we have multiple extremely unique wands from the movies?

I just feel sort of cheated, because I bought my wand thinking it was unique. That perhaps there would be more than just a handful of wand looks.(There isn’t even a HANDFUL, there’s THREE.)

I really wanted to get a wand that connects with ME. Not that is coded to a few silly questions about my height and eye colour.

I know the wand chooses the wizard and there’s no TRUE way to get that to happen in real life… and I know that I’m kind of just seeking out a different wand even though the Wizarding World wand ‘chose’ me… but I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel legitimate to me. It’s unsatisfying to say the least.

So, FINALLY, here’s the question. Does anyone know where I could have someone actually assess me and pair me with a suitable wand?Someone who designs wands and who can help me get a wand look that resonates with me?Someone who maybe knows a lot about wands in the HP universe and can help me with this?Someone like (dare I say) a metaphorical Ollivander?

I guess I just want to be original because I know, should the HP universe be real, everyone’s wand would be.

Thanks for reading my rant haha! I’m sure no one will reply or help because I understand that it’s a tricky question to answer. But, if anyone does take the time to respond and help me out, I’d be extremely thankful.

Thanks everyone!

But then there was the wand. Now, the wand thing really pees me off. Not because I have anything against a 10” Chestnut hard wand with a Unicorn hair core – but because there are ONLY. THREE. IMAGES. OF. WANDS.

When I found out this piece of information, I was like… are you JOKING me? Because I was extremely excited about my Wizarding World/Pottermore wand, so I bought a replica online. It basically feels like I’ve been cheated, because it’s not *truly* what my wand would have looked like, is it? Especially considering Ollivander said that no two wands are the same.

Of course, he didn’t just mean visually, he also meant internally and temperamentally – but the look of the wand can’t just be disregarded when he stated that no two wands are the same, otherwise how would we have multiple extremely unique wands from the movies?

I just feel sort of cheated, because I bought my wand thinking it was unique. That perhaps there would be more than just a handful of wand looks.(There isn’t even a HANDFUL, there’s THREE.)

I really wanted to get a wand that connects with ME. Not that is coded to a few silly questions about my height and eye colour.

I know the wand chooses the wizard and there’s no TRUE way to get that to happen in real life… and I know that I’m kind of just seeking out a different wand even though the Wizarding World wand ‘chose’ me… but I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel legitimate to me. It’s unsatisfying to say the least.

So, FINALLY, here’s the question. Does anyone know where I could have someone actually assess me and pair me with a suitable wand?Someone who designs wands and who can help me get a wand look that resonates with me?Someone who maybe knows a lot about wands in the HP universe and can help me with this?Someone like (dare I say) a metaphorical Ollivander?

I guess I just want to be original because I know, should the HP universe be real, everyone’s wand would be.

Thanks for reading my rant haha! I’m sure no one will reply or help because I understand that it’s a tricky question to answer. But, if anyone does take the time to respond and help me out, I’d be extremely thankful.

Thanks everyone!

now i personally believe that although this was described as snapes biggest regret i still believe he should not have been allowed a job at hogwarts/redemption and let me share why. 

during the scene where harry finds out that snape was the one who told voldemort abt the prophecy dumbledore states that snape had no way of knowing that harrys parents would be voldemorts target. however had he known what outcome his actions would have had he would not have proceeded. thus i believe that snape only viewed working for voldemort as his ""biggest regret"" because lily, the woman he loved, was murdered due to voldemorts interpretation of the prophecy. but had it been anyone else i don't think he would have cared as much. 

lily dying is seen as snapes turning point and the sole reason dumbledore trusted him to work alongside him. but what if it had been anyone other than lily? would he still have changed?

Ever wondered why Harry is not behaving like himself in it? or why we barely see him or the original trio at all? Why Cedric Diggory ever becomes a Death Eater? What's the deal with Voldemort having kids? And what's with all the time travel, didn't JK Rowling specifically say she smashed all of the Time-Turners in OP to get rid of this plot device?

**What if we could make the Cursed Child better? What if we could make it fit better within the Harry Potter series?**

I'm working on a ""fix"" of the Cursed Child story with my own (upcoming) series of books (Harry Potter and The Lost Child is the first of five):

[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child)

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon adherent, the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Review and Suggestions are welcome!

New chapter every other week or so!"

734,lzd48x,Epilogue at King's Cross - The Significance of HP's Ending Location,"I know the DH epilogue attracts a lot of criticism from fans, from the lengthy 19 year timeskip, to the kids' names, to lack of information about Hogwarts post-battle or the trios' jobs, etc. The epilogue is probably the least loved chapter of the whole series, and not just because it's the last one. This post makes a case for the significance of setting the epilogue at King's Cross. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my argument boils down to Chapter 35 of DH: King's Cross. In every book ending except HBP, Dumbledore explains to Harry and readers the mysteries at work up to that point of the story. This was the last time Dumbledore reveals answers to some of the last and greatest mysteries of the series. It's worth reading these two visions of King's Cross, chapter 35 and the epilogue, against each other.  

&gt;“**I’ve got a choice**?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in **King’s** **Cross**, you say? I think that **if you decided not to go back, you would be able to** ... let’s say ... **board a train**.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“And where would it take me?”  
&gt;  
&gt;""On,"" said Dumbledore simply. 

This is Harry's final choice of the series, taking place after he has chosen to walk freely to his own death. This is the cross roads chapter, making the epilogue a resolution to this moment. The epilogue answers the question of where Harry's life took him in his choice to go back (let's call it the train not chosen): a life where he has a family and children to send off to their own adventures. As cheesy as it is to say, because of Harry's choice not to board a train at this otherworldly King's Cross, his kids can board a train to go to Hogwarts. Whereas the journey to King's Cross occurs towards the beginning of the other 6 books, before the year's escapades at Hogwarts can start, this time we end at King's Cross where a new adventure for a new generation is bound to begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But **you want me to go back**?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I think,"" said Dumbledore, ""that **if you choose to return**, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love**. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. **If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye** for the present.""

In the King's Cross limbo, Harry's first reaction is to ask if Dumbledore wants him to go back; he hasn't expressed the desire to return himself. Dumbledore plainly states Harry's life's goal, ""you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart,"" which is what the epilogue fulfills in showing us the Weasley-Granger-Potter family and a host of innocent children. Instead of families ""torn apart"" we see families formed (there's even a hint of Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley getting together). There was a nod to Draco Malfoy, as the poster child of un-maimed souls (it was his soul that Dumbledore and Snape schemed to protect). 

I think it's important that Harry's first reaction when facing the choice to return is to glance at the flayed child form of Voldemort. Here's how it was described earlier:

&gt;It had the form of **a small, naked child,** curled on the ground, **its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted**, stuffed out of sight, **struggling for breath**.

Voldemort had maimed his soul in order to tether his soul to life and avoid death. The name he created himself means ""flight from death,"" and this moment reveals where Voldemort's efforts have truly gotten him. Here we have the form of the most pitiable figure imaginable: ""flayed...shuddering...unwanted...struggling for breath."" It is Voldemort Dumbledore refers to when he tells Harry to ""pity the living, and above all, those who live without love."" Voldemort alone is stuck in the expanse of this mysterious in-between area. Dumbledore and Harry both leave this place because the living and the dead are able to move ""on"" in a way that Voldemort has refused to. 

In contrast with the child form of Voldemort in King's Cross, the epilogue is populated by actual children. Voldemort had damaged himself so immensely that his child form had been mutilated and suffering as a result of his actions. Harry's children bear names of the dead who, memorialized, live on in a way that Voldemort didn't all because Harry valued love. Harry moves on to a future, a life of love, which is the key difference that separates him from Voldemort.

&amp;#x200B;

The epilogue shows a lot growth in Harry compared to the young adult we saw in the King's Cross of Chapter 35. At that time, it was still Dumbledore who held all the answers and needed to answer Harry's many questions, but in the King's Cross in the epilogue, Harry has taken up Dumbledore's role of explaining and reassuring. In his role as a dad, Harry resembles Dumbledore as Harry knew him; there are echoes of his relationship to Dumbledore in his relationships with his own kids. Like Dumbledore, he's rather indulgent. He advises Albus not to let his brother rile him up, but doesn't seem too concerned about James' teasing (""he likes a laugh, your brother""). He comforts Lily, promising, “It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too.” And he tells Albus not to worry about sorting into Slytherin, revealing a secret knowledge to him alone: ""if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."" 

Harry is understated in the epilogue. People still stare at him, but his own children and niece/nephew don't seem to know why he's famous. Harry has never enjoyed his own limelight, but this ending, where there is no hint any of Harry's heroics or accomplishments, highlights the ways that Harry is fundamentally unlike the Voldemort left behind at King's Cross in chapter 35. The fact that Harry's tale as the Boy who Lived is somewhat irrelevant here (it doesn't matter to the children, who are concerned with their own Hogwarts' journeys), pushes Voldemort further into obscurity. Harry is here as a father and uncle, not as the hero of the Wizarding World or a powerful, legendary wizard. The epilogue continues Harry's story as a journey of love. The flayed figure was under a seat, ""unwanted,"" while Harry is surrounded by loved ones. It was Voldemort who clung to permanence and stagnancy.

&gt;The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. **Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him**. ...",2021-03-06 22:45:05,0,discussion,72,0.98,0,2,72,0,23,0,0,0,Sat,5,1,"Epilogue at King's Cross - The Significance of HP's Ending Location I know the DH epilogue attracts a lot of criticism from fans, from the lengthy 19 year timeskip, to the kids' names, to lack of information about Hogwarts post-battle or the trios' jobs, etc. The epilogue is probably the least loved chapter of the whole series, and not just because it's the last one. This post makes a case for the significance of setting the epilogue at King's Cross. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my argument boils down to Chapter 35 of DH: King's Cross. In every book ending except HBP, Dumbledore explains to Harry and readers the mysteries at work up to that point of the story. This was the last time Dumbledore reveals answers to some of the last and greatest mysteries of the series. It's worth reading these two visions of King's Cross, chapter 35 and the epilogue, against each other.  

&gt;“**I’ve got a choice**?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in **King’s** **Cross**, you say? I think that **if you decided not to go back, you would be able to** ... let’s say ... **board a train**.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“And where would it take me?”  
&gt;  
&gt;""On,"" said Dumbledore simply. 

This is Harry's final choice of the series, taking place after he has chosen to walk freely to his own death. This is the cross roads chapter, making the epilogue a resolution to this moment. The epilogue answers the question of where Harry's life took him in his choice to go back (let's call it the train not chosen): a life where he has a family and children to send off to their own adventures. As cheesy as it is to say, because of Harry's choice not to board a train at this otherworldly King's Cross, his kids can board a train to go to Hogwarts. Whereas the journey to King's Cross occurs towards the beginning of the other 6 books, before the year's escapades at Hogwarts can start, this time we end at King's Cross where a new adventure for a new generation is bound to begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But **you want me to go back**?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I think,"" said Dumbledore, ""that **if you choose to return**, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love**. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. **If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye** for the present.""

In the King's Cross limbo, Harry's first reaction is to ask if Dumbledore wants him to go back; he hasn't expressed the desire to return himself. Dumbledore plainly states Harry's life's goal, ""you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart,"" which is what the epilogue fulfills in showing us the Weasley-Granger-Potter family and a host of innocent children. Instead of families ""torn apart"" we see families formed (there's even a hint of Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley getting together). There was a nod to Draco Malfoy, as the poster child of un-maimed souls (it was his soul that Dumbledore and Snape schemed to protect). 

I think it's important that Harry's first reaction when facing the choice to return is to glance at the flayed child form of Voldemort. Here's how it was described earlier:

&gt;It had the form of **a small, naked child,** curled on the ground, **its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted**, stuffed out of sight, **struggling for breath**.

Voldemort had maimed his soul in order to tether his soul to life and avoid death. The name he created himself means ""flight from death,"" and this moment reveals where Voldemort's efforts have truly gotten him. Here we have the form of the most pitiable figure imaginable: ""flayed...shuddering...unwanted...struggling for breath."" It is Voldemort Dumbledore refers to when he tells Harry to ""pity the living, and above all, those who live without love."" Voldemort alone is stuck in the expanse of this mysterious in-between area. Dumbledore and Harry both leave this place because the living and the dead are able to move ""on"" in a way that Voldemort has refused to. 

In contrast with the child form of Voldemort in King's Cross, the epilogue is populated by actual children. Voldemort had damaged himself so immensely that his child form had been mutilated and suffering as a result of his actions. Harry's children bear names of the dead who, memorialized, live on in a way that Voldemort didn't all because Harry valued love. Harry moves on to a future, a life of love, which is the key difference that separates him from Voldemort.

&amp;#x200B;

The epilogue shows a lot growth in Harry compared to the young adult we saw in the King's Cross of Chapter 35. At that time, it was still Dumbledore who held all the answers and needed to answer Harry's many questions, but in the King's Cross in the epilogue, Harry has taken up Dumbledore's role of explaining and reassuring. In his role as a dad, Harry resembles Dumbledore as Harry knew him; there are echoes of his relationship to Dumbledore in his relationships with his own kids. Like Dumbledore, he's rather indulgent. He advises Albus not to let his brother rile him up, but doesn't seem too concerned about James' teasing (""he likes a laugh, your brother""). He comforts Lily, promising, “It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too.” And he tells Albus not to worry about sorting into Slytherin, revealing a secret knowledge to him alone: ""if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."" 

Harry is understated in the epilogue. People still stare at him, but his own children and niece/nephew don't seem to know why he's famous. Harry has never enjoyed his own limelight, but this ending, where there is no hint any of Harry's heroics or accomplishments, highlights the ways that Harry is fundamentally unlike the Voldemort left behind at King's Cross in chapter 35. The fact that Harry's tale as the Boy who Lived is somewhat irrelevant here (it doesn't matter to the children, who are concerned with their own Hogwarts' journeys), pushes Voldemort further into obscurity. Harry is here as a father and uncle, not as the hero of the Wizarding World or a powerful, legendary wizard. The epilogue continues Harry's story as a journey of love. The flayed figure was under a seat, ""unwanted,"" while Harry is surrounded by loved ones. It was Voldemort who clung to permanence and stagnancy. Harry, who is shown moving on as life changes, is living with love and watching his own son's ""excitement"" as his son leaves on the train. Thematically, the epilogue brought a lot of book themes full circle, even it it frustrated people in its overly-sentimental conclusion.

786,lzk4me,The conundrum of Pensieves and other truth-telling methods,"Pensieves and other magical means of telling the truth highlight one of the big weaknesses in Rowling's writing; she tends to invent these things that are very interesting for the book they're introduced in, but she doesn't take into consideration the impact said item might have on the future stories or the ones already out if they're something that, by virtue of what it can do, can break an entire storyline.

Pensieves are one such example of this, and it really shows at the end of *Goblet of Fire*.  As I believe u/JulianApostat has brought up, the fact that there are surefire ways in the Wizarding world to confirm if someone is  lying or not should have major implications for how the justice system works in the wizarding world, but whenever a trial comes up, no one even thinks  about it.   

And more importantly, there are many times throughout the books where some important events happen with either no witnesses, or the only witnesses are kids (typically Harry) and afterwards no one believes them. This is the sort of situation where the adults should look at Harry's memories of the events in question, or if still in doubt, use a Time Turner to send back an invisible observer.

A good example of this is at the end of *Goblet of Fire*, after Barty Crouch Jr. gets kissed by the Dementor that Fudge brought with him. Fudge is refusing to believe Voldemort has returned.     Everyone's like  ""Omigod, Fudge just fed the very important witness to  a Dementor, and now we have no way to prove the truth!"" Yet the  confession of Crouch Jr. is recorded in the memories of four people  along with, in one case, the very events in question. All Dumbledore has to do is make a quick dash  for the Pensieve, and suddenly Fudge is faced not with an  unsubstantiated allegation, but with irrefutable proof that  is far harder to reject without looking like a coward.   The Pensieve of Harry's memories would be very useful here, because as dense as Fudge may be, he would have a hard time claiming that Harry simply imagined the whole scene down to the very last  detail, like the real-life cemetery he'd never been to, something easily  verifiable, since Dumbledore knows of Riddle's origins. (And before anyone uses that bullshit ""memories can be altered"" argument, let me remind you that  Pensieve tampering is *really really easy to spot*. It's blatantly visible even to the naked eye of an untrained observer, such as Harry.    And that was with Slughorn, an Occlumens skilled enough to block out Dumbledore mentally)  

 That and/or they could have just used the very convenient Time Turners  introduced in the previous book to just go back in time under an Invisibility Cloak to witness the events at the  cemetery. Even if Fudge  didn't want to, it beggars belief to think that Dumbledore wouldn't be  able to prove it.   Dumbledore at this time holds a lot of  political  influence, enough that he shouldn't be so easily outplayed by Fudge. He could've gotten Harry's story out to the press, he could've had Harry testify befor the Wizengamot as to what happened, etc, etc..

Then in *Order of the Phoenix*, a pensieve would've also come in handy at Harry's trial. Harry could have demanded to have his memories checked in a Pensieve  regarding the Dementor attack, showing irrefutable proof that there were Dementors in Little Whinging, but the thought of that never crosses his mind.  If it was explained that Fudge was obstructing all attempts for Harry to get a hearing with Pensieve viewing, it would be one thing. but clearly, in both of these cases, the real reason Pensieves, Time Turners and/or Veritaserum weren't used was because they would've broken the plot.",2021-03-07 05:34:53,0,discussion,4,0.7,0,0,4,0,11,0,0,0,Sun,6,1,"The conundrum of Pensieves and other truth-telling methods Pensieves and other magical means of telling the truth highlight one of the big weaknesses in Rowling's writing; she tends to invent these things that are very interesting for the book they're introduced in, but she doesn't take into consideration the impact said item might have on the future stories or the ones already out if they're something that, by virtue of what it can do, can break an entire storyline.

Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

799,lzlq8w,What bothers you about the Harry Potter books?,"There are two things that bother me (besides Rowling saying she now hates putting Ron and Hermione together, something that only happened after she took to the internet and discovered people hated it).

1. Voldemort isn't actually that big of a deal internationally

This is more of an insight I gained while I was listening to the audiobooks last time.

In Goblet of Fire, Cornelius Fudge is talking with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (I believe he's the Bulgarian one). He suddenly comes across Harry Potter and delightedly tells his fellow national leader “This is Harry Potter, the one who killed You-Know-Who!”

And the Bulgarian basically goes, “Interesting”. Frankly, he isn't all that uber impressed by it. When I listened to this, my eyes grew wide as a sudden realization hit me.

Voldemort was a localized threat. A national phenomenon, not world-wide. Yes, he gathered dark witches and wizards to his cause and brought in foreign aid like the giants and trolls to help him.

But he never was that big of a threat outside the UK. Maybe not even into Ireland. Why? I don't think he ever actually intended the conquest of the world.

We never know what his end goal really is. But I think he only wanted the UK, purge it of the non-desirables, and would have just sat there, nice and pretty. Or ugly in his case.

Another plot point in the story reinforced this reading of how localized Voldemort actually was.

That would be Fleur Delacour. Most people simply assume it was love that kept her in the UK when Voldemort retook power. I think it's more than that.

She is French, and yet, she doesn't fear him. Fleur lived right across the English Channel and yet she wasn't taught to fear him, because for her, as a French woman, he held no power over her.

She viewed Voldemort the same way Americans viewed Fidel Castro. An evil man, but he was so small fish that the average American had no need to even think about him, nor fear him, despite him being a very close neighbor.

It’s weird because Rowling wanted to make Voldemort some sort of worldwide threat and yet when you read of foreign characters, they seem to not even care about him.

But anyway, onto what really annoys me in this universe.

2. How magic has basically stagnated the Wizarding Community

You may be scratching your heads and saying “I don't understand.” All shall be revealed to you.

In Harry Potter 1, one of the very first things Harry learns is that the wizarding community has remained secret for the sake of the Muggles. “If they knew there was magic in the world, they would want to use it to solve every problem in their lives.” Except, that's exactly what the wizarding world does!

You never see Molly Weasley do anything without magic, besides chastising her family. She cooks, she does it with magic. Cleaning, magic. She doesn't even turn the knob on her radio by hand, instead using magic to do it.

She literally can stand, move and turn on her radio. Then again, we don't turn on TVs if we don't have to but we are talking about the wizarding world.

Harry breaks his arm during the Second Year Quidditch match when hit by a Bludger. Then Lockheart tries to fix it, instead completely making the bones disappear! What if it had been a leg? What if, heaven forbid, it was Harry's skull!

He doesn't even feel that overly bad about it. Why? Because magic! By the very next day, all Harry's bones have been regrown. In a single day and night!

You get hurt in the Wizarding world, and there is almost nothing that can't be instantly cured. Instead of being bed-ridden for weeks, you are up and about, as if nothing has happened.

In Deathly Hallows when they are setting up for a massive meal prior to the wedding of Bill and Fleur, the boys decide to get into a magical battle with all the tables and chairs. They break several pieces of furniture, yet there is no consequences besides Molly screaming at them. They don't have to go out and buy new furniture, dipping into their small banking accounts.

Why? Because magic instantly fixes all the furniture.

There is nothing learned from the experience. They aren't forced to go without a table or chairs for their reckless behavior, they don't have to spend any money on it. There is no punishment for destroying the furniture.

Magic has turned the entire society stagnant. Their most modern technology? Radios and moving photographs. Men haven't gotten to a point they wear jeans; just robes. They don't have electricity, which astonishes them so greatly that an entire class in muggle studies revolves around electricity. I think a scene from the movies describes their utterly Medieval Society.

The “rubber duck” comment. While a movie-only line, I think it was put in the movie to show how magic has put them so out the times of the world around them. They are so simplistic in their level of technology that one of the simplest things in the Muggle World is beyond their comprehension.

Let us also not think about how they literally have a tournament that they send their kids to where their chances of dying are extremely high. Their very first trial? Facing off against a dragon that their spells have little effect on. Yes, it’s only meant for 6th Years on up, but this was only after they revised the rules because too many kids were being killed in it.

It’s like magic completely made them irresponsible as adults and guardians for the very kids they are supposed to be protecting.

Magic is very important to the wizarding world…..but perhaps it is too important to them.

So what bothers YOU the most?",2021-03-07 07:28:55,0,question,3,0.71,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,0,Sun,6,1,"What bothers you about the Harry Potter books?

814,lzmm5q,"Questions about Voldemort between 1981 and 1991, the Prophecy, and the Death Eaters","Voldemort is vanquished for the first time in 1981, as we know, and does not truly reappear in any meaningful way until 1991.

My questions are as follows:

1. What was he doing during this time? I saw an old post that said: ""Voldemort was living off of rats and snakes. Inhabiting their bodies long enough to survive before moving on. We know he had some magical abilities at that point, but they were severely limited on his host body."" Is this mentioned in the books? How weak of a condition was he in, magically speaking?

Without the help of Quirrell or any of his other followers, would he have remained in that weakened condition in the Albanian Forest permanently?

2. Did most of his former followers believe him to be permanently gone? IIRC the only people who believed he would come back were Dumbledore, Snape, Barty Crouch Jr, and Bellatrix - am I wrong?

3. Did any of his former Death Eaters (even ones like Malfoy) hold ANY level of genuine regret over their actions, even if they still believed in 'the cause?'

4. Getting to the Prophecy, was it inevitable? What I mean is, was it 'destined', if you will, that Voldemort would return and be defeated by Harry? Or did Voldemort himself set the Prophecy into motion by going after Harry in the first place? For example...Say he disregarded the Prophecy, and didn't go after the Potters....What then? Would Harry still have grown up to be able to challenge him some other way? I'm curious about what the books (I haven't read them in a LONG time) or Rowling has said about the role Destiny or Fate played in it.

5. A controversial question....I know as a young man Dumbledore had a bit of ""prejudice"" shall we say against Muggles, and that is in part what initially made him join with Grindlewald in their idea of a ""pure"" world. Would a younger, pre-Arianna's death Albus have joined Voldemort? Or was he too strong minded to be a follower?

Thanks all. Again, I haven't read the books since they first came out; and I'm 30 now and wanting to rediscover the world.

1. Voldemort distanced himself from her and they stopped speaking after the Department of Mysteries fiasco.

2. He confined her to Malfoy Manor after Harry's escape.

Here are the punishments others who made the same mistakes got:

1. Voldemort sent Lucius's only son on a suicide mission. 

2. Lucius bore the marks from his punishment for Malfoy Manor for at least two months even though Bellatrix was the one who actually summoned Voldemort.

3. Rowle and Dolohov were Cruciated and threatened to be fed to Nagini for letting Harry escape.

She was unscathed and very close to Voldemort in the final battle merely a day after the Cup was stolen from her vault, but Voldemort's anger was said to be 'terrible to behold' when he forced the truth about the diary out from Lucius. He made amends to her only for humiliating her in the meeting and even reassured her, but his response to Lucius worrying about the safety of his child was 'it's not my fault if your son dies'.

First post here, but I just started re-reading the series for like the 4th or 5th time tonight. As I read Chapter 1 of the first book, I realized a kind of random and funny observation I’ve always been curious about. 

In the section where Vernon Dursley is heading home from work and he bumps into someone, does anyone remember if we’re ever told explicitly who that is? I realize that’s a super small detail, but for me personally I’ve always imagined it as Professor Flitwick  (at least from my second read through on, I obviously didn’t think of it in my first read.) 

My main reason why is because the individual is described as “a tiny old man wearing a violet cloak” having “ a squeaky voice that made passerby stare” and also as “hugging Mr. Dursley around the waist”. Essentially, a very short, older wizard with a squeaky voice and violet cloak.

853,lz1cua,The only reason Hermione was sorted into Gryffindor was plot convenience,"And I don't think Ravenclaw is the house that suits her best, either. I think this will get long since I've found a good amount of stuff in the books to support the claim that Hermione's personality is very much Slytherin in a lot of ways. The only thing that prevented her from being sorted into it is her muggle heritage and the only reason muggleborns are not sorted into Slytherin is plot convenience to make Slytherin the evil house full of pureblood supremacists and have a defined group of antagonists in Hogwarts.

Let's look at the traits associated with each house.


Gryffindor: courage, bravery, determination, daring, nerve, chivalry

Hermione does things that indeed require a good amount of courage and bravery, but not without planning things before hand. She is very *resourceful* and focused on damage reduction, one could say *self-preserving* when doing something 

She is determined, which is also a Slytherin trait and has great *ambitions*

I'm unsure about the daring part. Hermione is willing to take risks to some extent, but as I said always focused on damage reduction.

Nerve is were it gets off. Sure, if you use it as a  synonym for courage it would still be fitting, but I rather interpret it as bold so I don't have 3 traits that basically come down to the same thing. Hermione is usually more subtle when she acts, though.

Chivalry and Hermione don't go well together at all. I've spent a good amount of time checking definitions of chivalry and it all boils down to honor and nobility in addition to 10 historical rules about defending the church. The issue is that Hermione does not fight fair or honorable. Stealing ingredients to make poly juice potion and spy on others is not honorable or noble. Attacking someone with magical birds out of jealousy is not noble. Making people sign a list without telling them it is hexed is not noble.


Hufflepuff: hard-working, patience, fairness, just, loyalty, modesty

Hard-working checks out, it very much alignes with the *determination* and *ambition* mentioned earlier.

Hermione is not necessarily patient. Sure, she rather takes longer to do something when this means the odds of succeeding are higher that way, but generally she is not patient. She acts rather annoyed when things take to long for her liking or others don't understand things she considers rather obvious.

I already mentioned that Hermione doesn't really fight fair. Of course you can argue that the ends justify the means, but that doesn't change anything about this.

Hermione has a strong sense of justice and morals, but what she considers to be just is basically what allignes with her personal agenda. If something doesn't fit her point of view she barely listens to the other person for example when Ron came back in DH or when she participated in bullying Fleur at the Burrow in HBP.

Hermione is loyal to her friends, unless she attacks them with magical birds because her feelings are hurt. 

Modesty is also not Hermione's strength. Sure, she doesn't gloat about always coming out on top of her class but her know-it-all attitude is not really modest.


Ravenclaw: wit, learning, wisdom, acceptance, intelligence, creativity

Wit, learning, wisdom and intelligence match perfectly, after all Hermione is supposed to be the brains of the group. This is also the reason many people say she should have been in Ravenclaw. 

Acceptance is one of this aspects that partially fit as long as certain conditions are met. Hermione is accepting, especially of people and magical beings that are discriminated against in the wizarding society. However, she is not accepting of different points of view or certain people who intend no harm (Fleur, Luna, Trewlawney). As soon as something doesn't fit her narrative the acceptance stops.

Creativity is also not her strength. She religiously sticks to what is written in the books. For example she saw that the altered recipes in the book of the HBP worked better than the ones in the book, but instead of investigating them she instantly refused to accept anything that is related to the book.


Slytherin: resourcefulness, determination, pride, cunning, ambition, self-preservation

Resourcefulness is one of Hermione's strengths. She is a quick thinker and able to make detailed plans to achieve her goals. The part where she led Umbridge to the forest in OotP is a good example for this.

Determination and ambition are also very prominent traits of her. When she has a goal she focuses on reaching it and works incredibly hard for it. She has the ambition to make magical Britain a better places for everyone, S.P.E.W. is a perfect example for this. Despite everyone telling her it's stupid she continued to work on it.

Hermione is very prideful, her attacking Ron out of jealousy is a perfect example for this. Her pride was hurt by him making out with Lavender.

Hermione is one of the most cunning characters in the entire series. The DA's list in OotP, the poly juice potion in CoS, setting Snape on fire in PS, catching Rita Skeeter in the jar in GoF and blackmailing her or confunding McLaggen in HBP are just some examples.

Self-preservation is not as obvious, but Hermione doesn't act reckless. She is usually very much aware of what she can get away with and acts accordingly.

So, this was only going through the lists of traits associated with each house, but there is more.

In PS the sorting hat sings:

 *those cunning folks use any means to achieve their ends*

This is basically Hermione. She has good intentions, but the way she tries to get to her goal are often not that honorable. This is not really shown to the reader, because Hermione usually proven right in what she does, even if it is objectively shitty behavior. Confunding McLaggen so that Ron makes the cut for the team? He turns out to be a massive douche later on. Letting Crookshanks hunt Scabbers? Scabbers turns out to be an evil wizard. Hating the HBP's book? There is dark magic written in it. Hexing the DA's list to **permanently** disfigure a potential snitch? Marietta rats them out.

Hermione only sticks to the rules when they don't interfere with her own agenda. When they don't she doesn't care for them. 


TL;DR If Hermione's parents had been magical, she would have ended up in Slytherin. The only reason she didn't is that JKR needed an evil house for pureblood supremacists and she needed to be in Gryffindor for plot convenience.",2021-03-06 13:14:27,1,discussion,13,0.71,0,0,13,0,33,0,0,0,Sat,5,1,"The only reason Hermione was sorted into Gryffindor was plot convenience And I don't think Ravenclaw is the house that suits her best, either.

866,lzflgb,"Harry's ""memory"" of James's and Lily's deaths","So I'm in the middle of a re-read of the series, and I've had something of an epiphany.

It's already been established that Harry couldn't see the thestrals before witnessing Cedric's death, even though he was present for Lily's murder. This was because although Harry \*technically\* saw death, he was too young to really understand what he'd seen and internalize it. In order for someone to see a thestral, they need to really *know* that they've seen death in order for the change to take place. Since Harry was exactly 15 months old at the time, he certainly didn't know what the heck was going on.

And yet, as we see in POA, Harry certainly appears to have a vivid recollection of that fateful Halloween night. Well, at least he seems to remember the words that were spoken, as well as the flash of green light of the curse. In fact, Harry's recollection of the conversation is really quite remarkable for a 15-month-old child. He remembers everything that James, Lily, and Voldemort said, word-for-word - even words that a child his age probably wouldn't know yet. He doesn't just remember tones, snatches of words, or garbled sounds - he remembers the whole conversation with perfect clarity.

How is this possible? I don't think it is.

I believe that the ""memory"" Harry experiences in POA whenever the dementors approach him is actually the memory of the Horcrux within him. That is to say, this is really the memory that Voldemort has of that fateful night. Since the Harry-Horcrux was made that very night, that memory would be fresh in the ""mind"" of that bit of Voldemort's soul. 

Before Harry understands what's happening in that memory, he seems to be reacting to it as an outsider, and is distressed that a woman is about to be killed. He put the pieces together and figured out that the woman screaming was, in fact, his own mother. But he didn't recognize that memory as his own - probably because it wasn't really his own memory. Prior to his first dementor encounter, Harry's only memory of that night was just a flash of green light, which would make sense, because he was only 15 months old.

When the dementors first encountered Harry, they probably recognized that Harry had a bit more soul than the average person, and began to try and ""eat"" that piece of soul, finding it irresistible. Once the dementors first touched that Horcrux soul-piece within Harry, I think that's when the connection between Harry, the Horcrux, and Voldemort was ""activated."" All of a sudden, Harry is able to remember something he shouldn't really be able to remember. It just so happens that this memory is the last thing the Voldemort soul piece would have remembered. And less than a year later, Harry began having strange visions involving Voldemort, seemingly happening in real time.

890,lyrw6i,Read all seven books at the same time,"Last summer, I did an experiment where I listened to the books all at the same time in chapter order. So, I'd read all chapters one in order, then all chapters 2 in order, and so on. It was mostly to try the series out in a new way as I've probably read each book once a year since each came out.

One major takeaway: it was interesting to see the growth of the characters as the series develops and the shift in tone. I assumed that the characters would get darker and the tone as well. Actually, in many ways, especially in the last three books, there's more humor than you would expect. The books get more concrete in the use of magic, as well. The latter books deal with how magic functions and less just a whimsical world full of quirky notes of wonder. It never gets as concrete or analytical as I would like, but that's just my taste.

It was also interesting to see how the first two chapters or so were vastly different. In the first three books, there's a heavier emphasis on readers who have never read the books, including in the second and third book a ""this is Harry Potter, a wizard who goes to Hogwarts, a school of magic"" whereas the next books don't even start with Harry at all or start with him without any prelude and just assume the reader is experienced. The amount of time we spend with him at the Dursleys varies quite a bit in each book.

What I had hoped was to see a lot of those connections develop over the story by layering it on top of itself. Instead, it seems more like a bunch of disparate interesting ideas that sometimes connect when convenient but don't always work well together. There are tonal and world inconsistencies galore. As with many building stories (I'm looking at you, Supernatural), some of the worldbuilding gets outright retconned if it doesn't fit the needs of the story in the moment. Magic is a means of telling a story and the world gets less realistic but more interesting as it builds out. That's a much more obvious flaw when looking at all of the chapters together and seeing how the world is depicted. It doesn't scale well, though I prefer the larger, more diverse world of the later books to the more insular, smaller world of the first few books.

It's also glaringly obvious that the fourth book is the bridge. There is one world in the first three books and a different world in the last three books. It's why I think the fourth is so divisive. It has to connect worlds that really don't work well together (the first three books develop a Hogwarts that is too small to support the world of the last three books). 

Anyway, I'd recommend giving this a try.

916,lyxyr3,What is your favorite Ron Weasley moment?,"There are so many great Ron Weasley moments. My favorite moment is the chess match.

Maybe it's a basic favorite, but it really showcases Ron's personality. We learn how strategic his is when he beats the chess set. We can see him be confident for once, and know that this is an area that nobody overshadows him in.

We also see Ron's selflessness. He was willing to sacrifice himself for not only his friends, but the fate of the wizarding world.

“Yes. . .” said Ron softly, “it's the only way . . . I've got to be taken.”

“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.

“That's chess!” snapped Ron. “You've got to make some sacrifices! I'll make my move and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”

“But —”

“Do you want Snape or not?”

“Ron —”

“Look, if you don't hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”

There was nothing else for it.

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now don't hang around once you've won.”

He stepped forward and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard around the head with her stone ark and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.”

I like this scene the most because this kid is only eleven, and he's doing things adults would never do! All three got chances to prove themselves in that chapter, but Ron's was by far the best.

Anyone who says Ron is a coward, or not good enough for the trio needs to read the same books I did.


Honorable mentions include:

Any funny remark that cheers Harry up. (including calling him on the “fellytone""

When he stands up on one foot to tell Sirius that he'll have to kill him before Harry.

When he is the one brave enough to apologize to Harry in the Goblet of Fire.

When he returns in the Deathly Hallows.

When the “Weasley is Our King"" song is turned into a Gryffindor version.

When he first kisses Hermione

When he first meets Harry

And lastly, when he tells Harry that he'll be there to support him the whole time at the end of the Half Blood Prince.

944,lz03h8,Hermione vs Ron who would win in a duel,"This might be over done (barely use this sub reddit so I won't know) but I want to know your opinions

Who would win in a duel between the chosen one's best friends, Hermione vs Ron, duel starts with them facing each other 5 m apart with no other weapons wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

Most people I knew are Hermione fans but turns out a lot of people on the internet like Ron so this thread might go either way

Personally I believe Ron would win, I've said it before, knowledge vs power, Hermione might know more spells and can use non-verbal curses. But I believe Ron has better feats in actual fights, most people who support Hermione usually talk about how she saved the trio multiple times and is insanely smart, but Hermione saving the duo never included beating anyone in a duel.

But Ron has pretty impressive battle feats, like fighting multiple death eaters in the ministry (Luna said ""them"" so I can infer he fought multiple DE and won or tied since we don't see other death eaters come out the door) hit a wasp mid air and protected Tonks from Bellatrix and Rudolphus in mid air (Tonks even commended him) In the manor he also did well against Narcissa, Draco and being able to disarm Bellatrix. He also fought five snatchers of (possibly could have been three since two were apparently fighting each other when he fought back) and he reacted faster then Hermione in the cafe and saved her, she would have been taken out of the fight immediately if not for him. (This also proves is definitely faster then the two of them) i also want to point out that he did perform that slug spell verblessly, Ron also is physically fitter, which is helpful for dodging or just being able to close the gap and punch her. Hermione did fight Bellatrix but she had Ginny and Luna with her (who are both rather talented) and they still were losing.

This won't have too crazy of pairings tho you will see some F/F and M/M. I wrote this because I couldn't find one like this here.

953,lz7rva,Albus Dumbledore is one of the most brilliantly written villains in all of Fantasy fiction,"For all the turd thrown JK Rowling's way about how horrible Voldemort is as a villain, I maintain that Albus Dumbledore is one of the most brilliantly written villains in all of fantasy fiction.

Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows really showed how much of a villainous monster Albus Dumbledore really was...

First, Order of the Phoenix:

From:

&gt;*“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”*

To...

&gt;*“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I don’t —”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined — not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.”*

To quote and paraphrase an awesome HP fanfic author summarizing Dumbledore's ""love"" for Harry in order to send him off to be a pig for slaughter. What Dumbledore essentially said was:

***“I concealed things from you because I loved you so much, and your innocent face just made me decide to lie and lie and lie to you. And you should be so grateful your aunt took you in and abused you for ten years, because at least you aren’t dead. And don’t you feel so guilty that people might have died because I loved you so much that I had to lie to you.”***

There also seems to be this desperate attempt to make Adolf Dumbledore - oh sorry, *Albus* Dumbledore - seem like some innocent hero doing horrible things to Harry because he cared. Are we really expected to believe that he cared? Cared so much that he didn't tell Harry the truth until after the only obstacle that could free Harry from his abusive relatives was 100% dead, he was head of the Wizengamot for years and apparently he felt nothing about Sirius Black being sent to prison without a trial nor opened-up any investigation for 13 years on a man being sent off to prison without due process, and *conveniently* Sirius Black happens to be free of all charges after his death once Dumbledore regains his status on the Wizengamot despite there still being no proof that Peter Pettigrew was alive. Dumbledore just conveniently gains the power to get Sirius's name cleared, so why not do it after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban? Because then, he'd lose the pawn needed to sacrifice himself for Dumbledore's Greater Good, of course.

It's quite clear that Dumbledore thinks himself infallible and all his plans to be infallible too. His arrogance is attested to in Half-blood Prince and Deathly Hallows:

&gt;“\[. . .\] being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” (Book 6, U.S. p. 197)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.” (Book 6, U.S. p. 570)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“And at last, my brother \[Albus\] had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was.” (Book 7, U.S. p. 566)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.” (Book 7, U.S. p. 716)

How humble! He seemed to think his flaws were loving too much, but I'd argue that it was his sheer arrogance. This man really seemed to think that he was infallible. Nowhere is this more clear than with Horcrux hunting; the level of stupidity in Dumbledore's plans is hilarious. First, in Order of the Phoenix, while mocking Sirius for not valuing his house elf Kreacher enough, right after Sirius's death no less!, Dumbledore makes a point saying how Wizards often underestimate the House-elves and overlook them. That's nice; too bad he does exactly that with Kreacher, no less! Presumably, he spent so many months researching the cave that Harry and he go to in Half-blood Prince, while paying no attention to Mundungus Fletcher's pilfering of 12 Grimmauld Place, which results in the very Horcrux Dumbledore sought to obtain enter into Dolores Umbridge's hands! The sheer incompetence is hilarious, yet the narrative and Dumbledore himself has you convinced that Dumbledore isn't a colossal idiot.

Let's talk about the other brilliant plan from Albus Dumbledore: Doing absolutely nothing to stop Draco Malfoy, resulting in Death Eaters like the Carrows, Greyback, and *Bellatrix fucking Lestrange entering Hogwarts and killing children.* What a brilliant move on almighty, infallible, goody-good guy Dumbledore! He cared for Draco's wellbeing so much that he let children die so he could potentially recruit another spy for his Order of the Phoenix! The same Order of the Phoenix that had a member illegally sell Black family heirlooms *and* a Horcrux. All because in the beginning of Book 6, Dumbledore convinced Harry Potter that it was for the ""Greater Good"" to let the Order of the Phoenix use Grimmauld Place.

Oh! Oh! Let's get to the *stupidest part* of Mr. Infallible's plans. He shows Harry a memory convincing Harry that a Horcrux is within the halls of Hogwarts hidden somewhere -- as if there's a Room of Hidden Things where they could find it -- and *does absolutely nothing to find the Horcrux that is within the Castle while taking a trip to a far off mountain with Harry to urgently find another Horcrux.* Apparently, Horcrux hunting is only urgent if it is outside of Hogwarts castle. Dumbledore and Harry are lucky that a Death Eater like Bellatrix didn't spot it, recognize it, and take it to return to Lord Voldemort since we know she knew about them and had one in the Lestrange vault.

But wait! It gets dumber and dumber! If Voldemort had simply cast the killing curse on Severus Snape in Book 7, then Dumbledore's harebrained schemes would have fallen apart and Harry wouldn't have known to sacrifice himself. And, by the way, Dumbledore postulating that Harry could come back - as some have claimed his ""look of triumph"" in book 4, Goblet of Fire, somehow implies despite it being so vague as to mean anything - the fact is that he had no way of knowing if Harry would survive or not. It never was tested before and at best, he could only speculate. So, no, he didn't send Harry ""knowing he'd survive"" as [some people fool themselves into believing](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/fxs61w/fans_who_hate_dumbledore_for_raising_harry_like_a/), he sent Harry without knowing what the consequences would be and being perfectly fine with the result of Harry dying for the Greater Good that he concocted in his head. Evidently, Harry Potter dying for the ""greater good"" is fine, but stopping Draco Malfoy before he brings Death Eaters to kill children isn't part of Dumbledore's ""greater good"" at all. People obsessed with ""proving"" that ""[Dumbledore loved Harry!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3m7bji/just_want_opinion_of_fans_did_dumbledore_ever/cvcn43t/)"" are hilarious. Where was the love for Harry in Snape's memory in Book 7? He MOCKS Snape *specifically for having any compassion for Harry*. Is that love?

It is hilarious that people go on and on with mental gymnastics trying to pretend Albus Dumbledore was ever a good person. When shown a Tom Riddle living in an orphanage with a not-so-nice upbringing, he failed to do anything and actually *took the advice of an 11-year old Tom Marvolo Riddle* to let the kid wander to the Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley alone. Dumbledore's negligent behavior that puts children in danger extends as far back as at least that, even if we discount that he got his own sister murdered through his incompetence -- assuming he didn't kill her himself since he seems to like blaming everything on Grindelwald and scapegoating him while presenting himself as a blameless victim who was too ""in love"" and ""blinded"" by it. And notice this, he *immediately* believes Tom Riddle is evil at age 11. Only a true villain could project his own failings onto a child and say the child therefore born evil. Albus Dumbledore is one of the greatest villains and incompetent Headmasters in all of fantasy fiction.

968,lylij4,Unpopular opinion: Harry named his children really beautifully.,"So most consider the names cringe-worthy, and granted Harry had no lack of brilliant people he could of honoured who sacrificed everything but I think the names he chose are beautiful.

So starting with the first born, James Sirrius Potter -

James and Sirrius, two best friends, Harry's Father whom he never got to know and his Father's best friend who was as close to a Father figure as he had known. Both lived their life to the full together and would both of done anything Harry needed. A fitting name for his first born and an even fitter pairing of the two names.

Second born, Albus Severus Potter -

Albus and Severus, I think this relationship was one filled with a mutual respect and was very complex. They saw eachother at their worst and did things for one another that could only result in a bond. Albus and Harry's bond was one filled with love and admiration. Snape and Harry's bond was a complex one, some of Snape's actions towards Harry and in general are inexcusable, but Harry knows and accepts the role Snape played in the defeat of Voldermort and I think him putting Albus and Snape's name together when his relationship with the two, was so different, shows the respect and admiration Harry feels for Snape in the end and I imagine both Snape and Albus would be honoured with the pairing of their names.

Third born, Lily Luna Potter -

Lily and Luna, two completely different witches but two witches that were never afraid to speak it how it was. If they ever met, I imagine they would be great friends. Luna, like Harry had lost her mother. Luna was there for Harry in ways not even Ron or Hermione could be, this unlikely friendship was so pure. They truly would be their for eachother no matter what.

976,lypqwx,Misconceptions You Had About Harry Potter When You Were Younger?,"What are some parts of the Harry Potter books that you misunderstood when you read them for the first time, at a young age? Here are mine, from when I first read the books as a little kid:

1) I used to think that the reason Ginny behaved so strangely around Harry in CoS was that she was starstruck by him being a celebrity. I didn’t realize she had a crush on him.

2) I believed Rob when he said that his hostility towards Hermione and Krum was about: *”Fraternizing with the enemy.”* I didn’t realize it was romantic rivalry.

3) I thought that when Umbridge was using hand motions to communicate with Hagrid during his inspection, she was mocking him for, as she put it: *”Resorting to crude sign language”* when he mimed the thestrals having wings. I didn’t realize that this, along with the slow, loud voice she used, was about treating Hagrid like an idiot.

4) I always read Umbridge’s silly interrupting cough as her literally saying the words: *”Hem hem.”*

5) When Umbridge and her gang snuck up on Hagrid at midnight, I didn’t realize they were trying to actually attack him with force. I thought they were just sneaking up on him to fire him in private, in the middle of the night. The reason I thought this is that Ernie Macmillan speculated that Umbridge clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawny’s. She didn’t *attack* Trelawny, she just fired her in a way that caught a lot of attention, so from Ernie’s words I concluded that she was just doing the same thing to Hagrid in private. This was something that confused me. I didn’t really get how a sacking suddenly escalated into a full-blown fight, or why this was a horrible enough method of sacking to infuriate Hermione so much.

6) I didn’t realize that “Won-Won” was Lavender’s mushy way of saying the name “Ron.” It sounded so much like “Wonton” that I honestly thought it was something Asian. Needless to say, I was very confused by that part.

So, imagining that the Balrog had caught the Fellowship, and that it had found the Ring on them, what would have happened?


Would it have sensed its power and claimed it for himself?


Would it have recognized the Ring's master, Sauron and returned it to him, even though iirc this Balrog never served Sauron. 


Is there another possibility I'm missing?


 All of it is assuming that during the fight the Ring didn't end up falling in the depths of Moria.

1038,m4mbrb,What's with all the Frodo hate and the Sam glorifying?,"First and foremost, my opinion. With that said: 

I mean, the guy had to carry a ring, something that not only devoured his mind, kept him in constant danger and was a physical burden, but was also an object of great desire, which given the right time, the strongest of minds would kill to have it for themselves, for almost a year. People give Sam credit for never giving up and always being at Frodo's side, but Frodo could have done the same. ""Hey Sam, my mental health is deteriorating, and I'm tired of carrying this thing around, so here's the ring, bye"". Sure, it would make us angry at Frodo, but it would also be totally reasonable, and even though Sam is very loyal, the burden of carrying the ring is bigger. And sure, Frodo would have kept the ring if not for Gollum, but the fact that he went from Hobbiton, all the way to Mordor and still had some semblance of sanity is incredible.

""But Tolkien said Sam was the true hero""

Quick Google search tells you the contrary

""It's because Elijah Wood's acting was bad""

Even though Elijah's acting might seem a bit wooden (pun intended) he captures a feeling I cannot describe entirely, but it's like the feeling of hopelessness. Sure, he might destroy the ring, but what comes after? Will he die in Mordor? Heck, will he even reach Mordor? With all these challenges, it seems even impossible at times. The only thing he's sure is that it will never go back to normal. But for some reason, he keeps going. If that's not bravery, I don't know what is.

""Frodo was only carrying the ring, Sam had to do all the other work""

Seeing Sam doing all the heavy work makes us feel like he is really the true hero, but that's because we know what working like that might feel like, and if Sam is doing the heavy work, Frodo is doing the massive work. The ring is like a drug. Imagine if you had to destroy a lot of drugs, but also had to use them every once in a while. You can't. You never done it, and you don't know how that feels.

So this is why, in my opinion, Sam isn't the true hero, but don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean Frodo is the true hero. So who is it then? Gandalf? Aragorn? Gimli? Legolas? Boromir? Merry? Pippin? Tom Bombadil? No. All of these are wrongs. The true hero is the Fellowship. Think of it like The Avengers. Who was the true hero in The Avengers? Was it Captain America? Was it Iron Man? Was it Hawkeye? No. They all contributed to the defeat of Loki. If you remove only one of these members, Loki would have won. And Sauron would have won, if not for every member of the Fellowship.

1148,m20m93,"Okay, a serious theory on that stupid question ""Why didn't the Eagles fly the Ring bearer to Mount Doom?""...","Okay, regarding the eternal and annoying question of why the Eagles didn't fly the Ring bearer to Mount Doom...

Imagine a scenario where they actually try that.  First of all, Rivendell is far too distant from Mordor for the Eagles to fly there: it would take several days even by flight, not to mention flying over the Misty Mountains.  They would have have to travel on foot until they were at least over the Mountains, before reaching the point where the Eagles could meet them.

Assuming the same scenario from the books doesn't occur and Gandalf survives the passage over the Mountains, he then summons Gwaihir and one or two other eagles, places Frodo on the back of one of them and mounts Gwaihir himself, and they all take off towards Mordor.  As they approach the Mountains of Shadow, watchers at the Black Gate notice or ""sense"" the incoming Eagles.  Word of this quickly reaches the Nazgul, who instantly communicate with Sauron.  They can certainly sense the Ring as it approaches.  Sauron immediately launches the Nazgul on their winged beasts to attack the Eagles and get the Ring.

Meanwhile, as the Eagles approach Mount Doom, they discover that flying into the area of an active volcano is not a good idea: the fire, smoke, and fumes prevent them from getting too close.  Therefore, they have to drop off the Ring bearer so that he can approach on foot.  Unfortunately, by this time they have been discovered by Sauron.  As they land, they see thousands of soldiers rushing to meet them, likely headed by the Nazgul.

And that is one possible reason why they did not fly the Ring to Mount Doom.",2021-03-10 15:54:22,0,,13,0.76,0,0,13,0,15,0,0,0,Weds,2,0,"Okay, a serious theory on that stupid question ""Why didn't the Eagles fly the Ring bearer to Mount Doom?""...

There is so much going on and so much symbolism and peak storytelling on a smaller scale than the rest of the LOTR. I just thought it would be really cool so see it come to life on the screen.

1172,m1xurd,Just watched the first movie for the first time.I may have a dumb question.,"Didn't Bilbo start ALL OF THIS? I mean, sauron was searching for this dormant ring for ages it seems. 

When you put on the ring it blasts a push notification to Sauron with its location and that dang ole eye locks on and sends out the troops! 

Im not sure how much time elapsed after the ring was lost, to the time Bilbo used it for his disappearing act but it sure seems that all hell broke loose IMMEDIATELY after he put it on. 

I understand you wanted to disappear, Thrill-bo, but damn in a land of magic and evil that was pretty careless. I know he couldnt have made the connection between that ring and the legendary/mythical ring of power, but in my mind this whole event started because he couldnt be asked to sneak out at night. No. He HAD to pullsome stupid disappearing act. 


Way to go, dumbo.

Enjoy your vacation.

(P.s. Im a hypercritic. I haaaaate the way people act in most movies, 10 yo kids with existential levels of feelings that adults have trouble processing, unnecessary exposition and just the uncanny valley of acting in most movies makes them absolutely dumb. 

Ive only seen the first of the three lotr and got dayum if it isnt the BEST movie ive ever seen. The acting is just unbelievably good. 
Gandalf falling into the pit didnt make me cry, Frodo's screams and face did.

1181,m1w1k5,The battle of minas tirith confuses me.,"The mordor force ranges from 45,000 to 60,000 in most estimates on quora, reddit and amino. So I'll go with that.
People estimate the gondorians to be between 4,000-5,000 at the battle.
Rohan was 6,000 strong.
And aragorn was 1,000-3,000 strong.
So let's start with gondor.
The mordor force launched catapults at the walls and broke the gate. But before troops actually engaged the riders of rohan arrived.
Considering the battle was still young I can't imagine many orcs or men died at this point.
So I'd say there were still at least 40,000 troops on the fields.
While I do see aragorn and the rohirrim beating them.
I can't imagine only 2,000 rohirrim dying.
In fact, that's almost 6 to 1.
I'm just saying the rohirrim would not survive.
People make the argument that orcs were scared or weaker or that they hated sunlight.
But I doubt thats enough for the good guys to win the battle and still have 7,000 left for the black gate.
Also aragorn would have to disembark and unload his ships one by one. Which would take forever, and the orcs would simply disrupt them.
I just have huge doubts to the small casualties at the battle.

1188,m1o39z,I'm writing a book series and would like it to nail things Lord of thr Rings has mastered.,"**Disclaimer: This is absolutely NOT promoting my book, this is 100% just for advice. I am also happy with my work and having it be independent but would just like some advice on how to do well on the things bellow.**

Hello. I am writing a fantasy book series and, in short, want to make it like Tolkien's. Kind of. 

I'm a avaergae Lord of thr Rings fan. I enjoyed all the movies, have the books and really loved the lore and backstory behind the books, though I'm really not that educated.

I'm trying to write a book series that takes inspiration from loads of things, and I would like the theme / style to be like Lord of the Rings.

What I mean by this may be confusing, but:

1. The World building. I've spent years planning the lore and backstory for my book making sure to make it as detailed as possible but falling flat on some places. I want my world building to be like that if Middle Earth.

When introduced Middle Earth feels like a massive original fantasy universe with everything detailed and planned and making even new readers feel like they occupy an already established fantasy world of which i would like to make mine like. Detailed and full of lore with everything feeling neat and polished. Classic fantasy races portrayed as how they are stereotyped and everyone kind of goes with it because it all feels so great.

2. Very detailed and complex story with Loveable and quirky characters. With the Lord of the Rings the story is so deep and complex and complicated having hundreds of years of backstory to help supper it further Tolkien managed to do this and introduce fun and loveable characters.

Bilbo, Gimli, Legeolas and many other characters get away with being funny and comical in a serious and complex story without making it feel awkward or imbalanced.

While I feel as a writer I have done this to an extent the way Tolkien has is masterful and amazing to see him managed to have these 2 conflicting qualities and not make the characters be boring or  make the story turn into a joke along with the characters.

These are just some things I wish to truly achieve as a writer for this series which Lord of thr Rings has mastered.

1198,m1mqkm,Boromir Theory,"So this might be old news to you all, but while watching LOTR with my wife something dawned on me about Boromir.

Boromir is an allusion to St. Peter of Christianity.

My reasoning behind this is that throughout the movie Fellowship of the Ring, Boromir asks for the One Ring three times: once in Rivendell, once on the mountainside, and once again right before his death. 

Jesus of Nazareth foretold that St. Peter would deny him three times, which are then confirmed to have happened by the gospels: once to a female servant of the high priest, another when he had gone out the gateway away from the firelight and a final time when his Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. 

To make matters even more interesting, Boromir is also struck by three arrows!

In the end of Two Towers, we get the flooding of Isengard, Sam's speech at Osgiliath, and then we hear Gollum's plan. As for RotK, well a whole lot is wrapped up, including with Aragorn's coronation, the return to the Shire, and the Grey Havens."

And sure, Gandalf was choosen because he was the wisest of them all. I can understand that Saruman is a jealous wizard but nothing to me seems to justify so much hatred.

Am I missing something?"

1327,lye5o2,Durin's Folk - Why Dwarves matter,"When it comes to the history of the Elves, we have the entire Silmarillion. When it comes to the history of Men, we have all of the Lord of the Rings and its appendices. But when it comes to the history of the Dwarves, sources get a little sparse. Now this isn't to say that Dwarven history is a mystery, or that they didn't contribute significantly to the events of the Third Age, but in comparison to Elves, Men, and even Hobbits of Middle-earth, the Dwarves are to an extent, exempt from the Great Tales of the Fading Years. And there's an in-universe reason for this. *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit* were of course first written by Bilbo and Frodo in the Red Book of Westmarch, and so if they didn't know something, it's not included. The Silmarillion is a little more complicated, but again, Tolkien tells us that is was compiled by a number of Elven (and at least one Mannish) chroniclers, and so it only includes information that its writers were privy to. There is no omniscient narrator. In fact Tolkien's fiction claims that all *he* did was translate the stories from Westron into English, (which begs the question, who taught Tolkien Westron?) Anyway, because much of Third Age Dwarven history takes place underground, far from the eyes and ears of Elves and Men, many of their Third Age stories are unknown to us. But not all of them.

So throughout most of the Third Age, dwarves fought orcs. In fact that sentence sums up a good chunk of all Dwarven history. And this was the way it had always been for countless generations. But, for six years in the Third Millennium, these generations of conflict erupted into an official and full-blown war between the two races. And I would argue that despite its lack of focus in the Great Tales, this War of the Dwarves and Orcs went on to affect the eventual fate of Middle-earth.

Now if you've seen The Hobbit movies, then this story won't be entirely new information. But there's a lot more to this conflict than The Hobbit movies show us, and there's a lot that they change. So without wanting to throw any shade at the movies, let's untangle the true nature of this legendary war between dwarves and orcs.

So when I said that this war lasted for six years, that was a little misleading. There were six years between the official declaration of war and the climactic battle, but the prelude to all this goes back to the very beginning of the Dwarven race, and I'd argue that it's aftermath extends all the way to the War of the Ring and the eventual defeat of Sauron. So perhaps we might consider that the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was just six years in a conflict that spans almost all of their history.

So if we're going to start right at the very beginning, I guess this whole thing begins way back before even the First Age, with the awakening of Durin the Deathless; AKA the first Dwarf ever. Now Durin the Deathless awoke in the mountain of Gundabad, which went on to become a revered and holy site amongst Dwarves for this very reason. And Durin also earned his epithet of *the Deathless* by living for at least 2395 years! Among his other claims to fame are that he was the founding father of the Longbeard clan, which accounts for every named Dwarf in the entire Legendarium, (except those Broadbeams and Firebeards of the Silmarillion), he was the founder of Khazad-dûm, and it was prophesied that Durin would be reincarnated seven times (whether literally or metaphorically is a matter of debate) before the Dwarven race eventually departs the world. So it's fair to say that Durin is a pretty legendary figure within Dwarven mythology. And as an extension of Durin's legacy, both Mount Gundabad and Khazad-dûm were revered places too.

So the reason this is significant is that by the time the War of the Dwarves and Orcs bubbled into existence, both Khazad-dûm and Mount Gundabad had been taken from the dwarves by their enemies. Thousands of years ago in the Second Age, Sauron ordered his orcs to conquer the holy mountain of Gundabad and turn it into an orc stronghold. Which they did. And 800 years before the start of the War, a balrog awoke in Khazad-dûm, killed King Durin VI, and Moria was swiftly abandoned. So just like the holy mountain of Gundabad, the revered city of Durin the Deathless also became an orc infested pit.

Now this was all obviously bad news for the Dwarves of Durin's folk, but things were destined to get a lot worse before they finally reached their breaking point. So without Khazad-dûm or Gundabad, the Longbeard Dwarves established new kingdoms in the North, chiefly the exiled Kingdom of the Grey Mountains (where many refugees of Moria fled to) and of course the Lonely Mountain of Erebor. And for a little while things were okay for the exiled dwarves of these realms. But then the dragons came.

So I guess one could argue that the War of the Dwarves and Orcs began right as the War of the Dwarves and Dragons came to a close. You see the Dragons were an absolutely devastating enemy for the Dwarves, and their war ended in absolute ruin. The Grey Mountains fell to the Cold-drakes of the North, and the king of the Grey Mountains was slain. Now this king had two surviving sons. The younger son was called Grór, and he established another exiled kingdom in the Iron Hills (which will be important towards the end), while the other brother was called Thrór and he took the Arkenstone and re-established the Kingdom of Erebor. And he's the old guy we meet at the beginning of The Hobbit movie. The grandfather of Thorin.

Now as I'm sure everyone will know, it wasn't long before Erebor faced a dragon of its own. And the dragon-fire of Smaug obliterated the Dwarven Kingdom under the Mountain. So twenty-three years before the official outbreak of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, the Longbeards of Durin's line were once again made homeless, and those who didn't flee to the Iron Hills were forced to wander south as refugees, into the foreign lands of Dunland, (where Rohan's enemies the Wild Men of Dunland lived).

Now it's a bit of a tangent, but I think it's worth mentioning that despite the movies portraying Thorin as barely ageing throughout these flashbacks, he was only 24 when Smaug sacked Erebor, which by Dwarven standards is very very young. And I think this is significant to his character because by the time of the Hobbit, Thorin is 195 years old. So he'd spent 171 years as a refugee. He was a prince and a king without a kingdom. All he had of Erebor were childhood memories from a lifetime ago.

Anyway, this is where things begin to heat up. Because as you can probably imagine, King Thrór was not happy about the multiple losses of his ancestral homelands, and he began to sink into a deep depression. Which certainly wasn't helped by the last of the Dwarven Rings that he still wore. So three years before the official outbreak of war, Thrór left his people, his ring, and the key to Erebor in Dunland with his son Thráin, and he set off with only one companion on a pilgrimage to the Great Gates of Durin the Deathless; the original entrance to the city of Khazad-dûm

Now Thrór and his companion Nár did successfully make it all the way over the Misty Mountains, and eventually they arrived in the Dimril Dale. Before them was Lake Mirrormere where Durin the Deathless had beheld the vision that inspired him to found Khazad-dûm in the first place. And beside the water's edge was the ancient Durin's Stone, which marked the spot where the first dwarf had stood and received this vision. So I imagine that from Thrór's perspective this must have been a bit like the culmination of a holy pilgrimage. Being the king of the Longbeards, Thrór decreed that Khazad-dûm was his by right, and that he was its heir. And furthermore the Great Gates were open. Surely this was a sign that the time had come for the Longbeards to reclaim Khazad-dûm. At least that's how Thrór saw it. However his companion Nár was more cautious.

So Nár begged Thrór to be aware of the dangers, and not to enter Moria alone. But Thrór was a king, and he refused to live without a kingdom any longer. So he passed through the Great Gate alone. And Nár awaited his return from the outside.

But Thrór never did come back.

You see inside Moria dwelt the infamous orc Azog. And I'm afraid there aren't too many details given about Azog other than his name. We don't know his age or his purpose in Moria, but it's very possible that he was a chieftain of those orcs sent by Sauron to populate Moria 310 years earlier. However we do know that he was one of the most important orcs in the North, and we also know that as far as the orcs were concerned, *he* was the King of Moria.

So after an unknown number of days waiting outside for his king, Nár eventually beheld a harrowing sight. King Thrór's headless body was flung out of the Great Gates, and his severed head immediately followed. Upon inspection, Nár found that across Thrór's forehead was branded the word AZOG in Cirth runes, and a moment later he was struck by purse containing *""few coins of little worth"".* The purse was thrown by Azog himself who allowed Nár to live simply so he could pass on the message to the rest of Durin's Folk. The implication of this macabre payment was clear. Azog would permit no future beggars to enter *his* kingdom, and he'd allow no others to declare themselves its king.

Now after thousands of years of ancestral conflict, this, the murder of King Thrór by the chieftain Azog, was the spark that eventually ignited the Dwarves and Orcs into a full-blown war.

You see when Thrór's son Thráin eventually learned from Nár what had happened to his father, he sat in silent contemplation for seven days, refusing to eat or to sleep. But, finally on the seventh day, Thráin arose from this throne and declared that *""this cannot be borne!""* And for the next three years, Thráin amassed what is probably the greatest Dwarven army ever assembled in Middle-earth's history. So Tolkien tells us that Thráin's host was *""joined by great forces sent from the Houses of other Fathers, for this dishonour...filled them with wrath,""* and this is an interesting detail because it implies that not only was Thráin's Longbeard army bolstered by Broadbeams and Firebeards of the West, but also potentially by the super mysterious Dwarves of the East. And when the Dwarven host was fully mustered, the great War of the Dwarves and Orcs began.

Now despite the length of this post, I'm afraid there's not a huge amount to say about the specific battles in this war. It mostly happened underground after all, and so neither Elven nor Mannish chroniclers ever truly learned the details of what happened. But what we can infer is that the Dwarves began in the North, and they systematically worked their way south cleansing the Misty Mountains as they went. And it seems that the first site the Dwarves reclaimed, was the first one they'd lost.

So 4537 years after Mount Gundabad was first sacked and populated by Sauron's orcs in the Second Age, the Dwarves of King Thráin finally re-conquered the holy mountain, and the orcs inside were slaughtered. Over the next six years, the Dwarven army moved south through the misty mountains, winning battle after battle ""*through their strength, and their matchless weapons, and the fire of their anger,""* until they finally arrived in the Dimril Dale. The very same place where Durin the Deathless had begun the founding of Khazad-dûm, and where Thrór's severed head had been cast out by Azog. Now in the Khuzdul language of the Dwarves, the Dimril Dale is known as Azanulbizar, and this was the name that was given to the epic battle that was fought here.

So, the Battle of Azanulbizar is that same battle that we see briefly in the first Hobbit movie, although Tolkien's telling of it differs significantly from Peter Jackson's. I mean to be fair, it is in this battle that a young Thorin (he was 54 at the time) used an oak branch as his shield and took up the epithet Oakenshield, which the movie does get right, but as we know Thrór was already dead when this battle started, Thràin was blinded in one eye, and perhaps the most significant change is the fate of Azog. Obviously in the movie he gets his arm cut off by Thorin and lives to fight another day, but in Tolkien's writings, this is completely different. It's not even Thorin who Azog fights.

Now, remember earlier when I mentioned Thrór's brother Grór founding a kingdom in the Iron Hills after the War of the Dwarves and Dragons, and I said these Dwarves would be important? Well it's in this battle that we see why. So, Grór has a grandson called Dáin Ironfoot, and Dáin is possibly my number one favourite dwarf in the entire Legendarium. He is utterly badass.

So Dáin Ironfoot, alongside his father Náin and the rest of the Dwarves from the Iron Hills, fought at Azanulbizar, and just like his cousin Thorin, Dáin achieved massive fame and acclaim in this battle. Now the Dwarves of the Iron Hills arrived late, and before they showed up it looked like the orcs might be victorious, but when they did finally arrive, they brought with them fresh reinforcements that turned the tide of battle. In fact Dáin's father Náin even fought his way all the way up to the Great Gate of Moria and demanded that Azog come out to fight him.

Now we're told that before this point in the battle, Azog hadn't yet emerged from Moria to risk his own life. But when Náin challenged him, he perceived that the time had come. So Azog emerged from the darkness, and he fought a one on one duel with Náin. Now Náin was a great warrior, and we can presume that he was a veteran of many battles, but when he faced Azog he was half blinded by rage. We're told that Náin swung at Azog with all his might, but the orc was nimble, and when Náin missed, Azog broke his neck. The King's cousin died instantly.

However despite Azog's personal victory, his orc army was routed and his guards were dead. So, like a coward, Azog turned towards the gate and tried to flee back inside Moria. But this didn't turn out the way he'd hoped. Dáin Ironfoot had just watched his father die at Azog's hand, and he had no intention of letting the orc escape to fight another day. So Dáin charged at Azog, and outside the gates of Moria he hewed the orc's head from his shoulders with his red axe. Now what's particularly nuts about all this is that Dáin Ironfoot was only 32 at the time. That may not sound especially young, but by Dwarven standards it really was. For comparison's sake, we're told that during the events of the Hobbit, Gimli the dwarf was too young to take part in the Quest of Erebor, being 15 years younger than their youngest member Kili. But Gimli was 62 when that happened. He was almost double the age of Dáin Ironfoot when Dáin killed Azog. Which makes Dáin an amazingly awesome young dwarf!

Anyway, after the Battle of Azanulbizar and the death of Azog, the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was declared over. Azog's severed head was impaled on a spike, and the same purse containing *""few coins of little worth""* was stuffed into his mouth. King Thrór was finally avenged. But the victory had come at a high cost. Although we're told that ten thousand orcs had been killed in the battle, the Dwarven dead were ""*beyond the count of grief.""* And although King Thráin sought to press his advantage and reclaim Moria once and for all, he was dissuaded by his nephew Dáin. You see while killing Azog, Dáin alone had looked into Moria, and he'd seen the shadow of Durin's Bane. In fact Dáin prophesied to the king that ""*some other power than ours must come before Durin's Folk walk again in Moria.""*

Now, on the one hand it would seem that this marks the end of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. However I would argue that although Azog's death begins a 142 year ceasefire, the conflict was not yet truly over. Because of course Azog is the only orc in the Legendarium who we're explicitly told has a son. And this son is another orc chieftain called Bolg. And Bolg would meet both Thorin and Dáin again before the very end.

So if we skip forward a century and a half from the Battle of Azanulbizar, Thráin's son Thorin Oakenshield will lead his Company to reclaim his grandfather's kingdom of Erebor from Smaug the dragon. Now this is pretty much the plot of the Hobbit, but of course once Erebor is reclaimed and the dragon is dead, there's one more battle that needs to be fought. And in the Battle of the Five Armies, Thorin and Bolg lead their respective forces once again to war. And once again, Dáin Ironfoot is there. And once again, Dáin Ironfoot watches a family member die in battle.

So with the eventual deaths of Thorin, Fili, and Kili, the line of Thrór is finally wiped out. But with the death of Bolg, so too is the line of Azog wiped out. And it would appear that with this, the war of the Dwarves and Orcs is finally ended.

But I would argue that there's one last epilogue, which brings this war full circle. Because to be honest upon reflection, this doesn't seem like a particularly happy ending. I mean Erebor once again belongs to the dwarves, and Dáin Ironfoot has taken his cousin's place as king, but Moria is still an orc stronghold, and at some point between the Battle of Azanulbizar and the Hobbit, orcs once again reclaim the holy mountain of Gundabad. The Dwarves may have won a pyrrhic victory, but it came at a heavy cost. And there's one more victory that needs to be won. And one more heavy price that needs to be paid.

You see in the year 3019, only two days after the famous Battle of Pelennor Fields, Erebor once again came under attack. However this time it wasn't a vengeful faction of Misty Mountain orcs, or a fire-breathing dragon that declared war on the Dwarves. It was an army of Sauron's Easterlings. And for King Dáin Ironfoot (who was now 252 years old), this would be the last time that he rode out to war.

So alongside the Men of Dale, the Dwarves of Erebor fought one more great battle, and they died for one more pyrrhic victory. You see, King Dáin was joined upon the battlefield by King Brand of Dale; the grandson of Bard the Bowman, and for three days they fought together against the servants of Sauron. However by the third day, the Easterlings were gaining the upper hand, and the union of Dwarves and Men were forced to retreat towards the doors of Erebor. There Brand and Dáin fought valiantly, but in the end King Brand was slain. The Dwarves and the Men of Dale retreated into the mountain where they were besieged. But Dáin did not retreat with them. Just as his nephews Fili and Kili had died defending Thorin's body 77 years earlier, Dáin stayed to protect the body of his fellow king Brand. And outside the doors of his kingdom, he too was slain.

But it was not in vain. After eight days of battle, something incredible happened. Thousands of miles away from Erebor, all the way in the South, the One Ring was ultimately destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Sauron was finally defeated. Now it took another two days for the Easterlings to eventually be driven off, but in the end, King Brand's son, Bard II, along with King Dáin's son, Thorin III, led their people out of Erebor, and they expelled the Easterlings from Dale for good.

Now the Battle of Dale may at first seem like little more than a footnote when compared to the much more famous Battle of Pelennor Fields, but it should't be disregarded as such. Gandalf himself actually states *""when you think of the great Battle of the Pelennor, do not forget the battles in Dale and the valour of Durin's Folk.""* We're told that if Dáin and Brand had failed to hold back the Easterlings in the North, then the scales would have tipped in Mordor's favour. The servants of Sauron would have joined with his forces at Dol Guldur, and regardless of the victory at Pelennor Fields, the armies of the West would have been overrun and crushed. Gandalf would have been unable to draw out Sauron's army at the Black Gate, and so it's doubtful that Frodo and Sam would have made it Mount Doom.

I feel like it's very easy to think of Dwarven history as being separate from the histories of Elves and Men. After all, for most of the Second and Third Ages they dwelt underground and kept out of the proverbial spotlight. There is no Dwarven equivalent of the Silmarillion, and most of the details of Dwarven lives are lost to us. But in spite of that, I don't think that Dwarven history is separate at all. If not for the Dwarves of Durin's Folk, it's highly likely that Sauron would have won. And Middle-earth would have fallen into darkness. If not for Durin's Folk ""*there would be no Queen in Gondor"",* there would be only *""ruin and ash.""* But over the centuries tens of thousands of Dwarves laid down their lives because they believed that orcs could not win. They believed that there was something good beneath the mountains and it was theirs. And in the end, their sacrifice paid off. At some unknown date in the Fourth Age, Durin the Deathless was reincarnated for the seventh and final time. Under his kingship the Dwarves reclaimed Khazad-dûm, and they prospered in their kingdoms beneath the earth, until the *""world grew old and the days of Durin's race ended.""*

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on Tolkien's dwarves (or dwarves in general). As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining all the lore in the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

Thanks again everyone. Much love and stay groovy ❤️",2021-03-05 15:22:27,1,,102,0.97,0,3,102,0,20,0,0,0,Fri,4,0,"Durin's Folk - Why Dwarves matter When it comes to the history of the Elves, we have the entire Silmarillion. When it comes to the history of Men, we have all of the Lord of the Rings and its appendices. But when it comes to the history of the Dwarves, sources get a little sparse. Now this isn't to say that Dwarven history is a mystery, or that they didn't contribute significantly to the events of the Third Age, but in comparison to Elves, Men, and even Hobbits of Middle-earth, the Dwarves are to an extent, exempt from the Great Tales of the Fading Years. And there's an in-universe reason for this. *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit* were of course first written by Bilbo and Frodo in the Red Book of Westmarch, and so if they didn't know something, it's not included. The Silmarillion is a little more complicated, but again, Tolkien tells us that is was compiled by a number of Elven (and at least one Mannish) chroniclers, and so it only includes information that its writers were privy to. There is no omniscient narrator. In fact Tolkien's fiction claims that all *he* did was translate the stories from Westron into English, (which begs the question, who taught Tolkien Westron?) Anyway, because much of Third Age Dwarven history takes place underground, far from the eyes and ears of Elves and Men, many of their Third Age stories are unknown to us. But not all of them.

So throughout most of the Third Age, dwarves fought orcs. In fact that sentence sums up a good chunk of all Dwarven history. And this was the way it had always been for countless generations. But, for six years in the Third Millennium, these generations of conflict erupted into an official and full-blown war between the two races. And I would argue that despite its lack of focus in the Great Tales, this War of the Dwarves and Orcs went on to affect the eventual fate of Middle-earth.

Now if you've seen The Hobbit movies, then this story won't be entirely new information. But there's a lot more to this conflict than The Hobbit movies show us, and there's a lot that they change. So without wanting to throw any shade at the movies, let's untangle the true nature of this legendary war between dwarves and orcs.

So when I said that this war lasted for six years, that was a little misleading. There were six years between the official declaration of war and the climactic battle, but the prelude to all this goes back to the very beginning of the Dwarven race, and I'd argue that it's aftermath extends all the way to the War of the Ring and the eventual defeat of Sauron. So perhaps we might consider that the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was just six years in a conflict that spans almost all of their history.

So if we're going to start right at the very beginning, I guess this whole thing begins way back before even the First Age, with the awakening of Durin the Deathless; AKA the first Dwarf ever. Now Durin the Deathless awoke in the mountain of Gundabad, which went on to become a revered and holy site amongst Dwarves for this very reason. And Durin also earned his epithet of *the Deathless* by living for at least 2395 years! Among his other claims to fame are that he was the founding father of the Longbeard clan, which accounts for every named Dwarf in the entire Legendarium, (except those Broadbeams and Firebeards of the Silmarillion), he was the founder of Khazad-dûm, and it was prophesied that Durin would be reincarnated seven times (whether literally or metaphorically is a matter of debate) before the Dwarven race eventually departs the world. So it's fair to say that Durin is a pretty legendary figure within Dwarven mythology. And as an extension of Durin's legacy, both Mount Gundabad and Khazad-dûm were revered places too.

So the reason this is significant is that by the time the War of the Dwarves and Orcs bubbled into existence, both Khazad-dûm and Mount Gundabad had been taken from the dwarves by their enemies. Thousands of years ago in the Second Age, Sauron ordered his orcs to conquer the holy mountain of Gundabad and turn it into an orc stronghold. Which they did. And 800 years before the start of the War, a balrog awoke in Khazad-dûm, killed King Durin VI, and Moria was swiftly abandoned. So just like the holy mountain of Gundabad, the revered city of Durin the Deathless also became an orc infested pit.

Now this was all obviously bad news for the Dwarves of Durin's folk, but things were destined to get a lot worse before they finally reached their breaking point. So without Khazad-dûm or Gundabad, the Longbeard Dwarves established new kingdoms in the North, chiefly the exiled Kingdom of the Grey Mountains (where many refugees of Moria fled to) and of course the Lonely Mountain of Erebor. And for a little while things were okay for the exiled dwarves of these realms. But then the dragons came.

So I guess one could argue that the War of the Dwarves and Orcs began right as the War of the Dwarves and Dragons came to a close. You see the Dragons were an absolutely devastating enemy for the Dwarves, and their war ended in absolute ruin. The Grey Mountains fell to the Cold-drakes of the North, and the king of the Grey Mountains was slain. Now this king had two surviving sons. The younger son was called Grór, and he established another exiled kingdom in the Iron Hills (which will be important towards the end), while the other brother was called Thrór and he took the Arkenstone and re-established the Kingdom of Erebor. And he's the old guy we meet at the beginning of The Hobbit movie. The grandfather of Thorin.

Now as I'm sure everyone will know, it wasn't long before Erebor faced a dragon of its own. And the dragon-fire of Smaug obliterated the Dwarven Kingdom under the Mountain. So twenty-three years before the official outbreak of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, the Longbeards of Durin's line were once again made homeless, and those who didn't flee to the Iron Hills were forced to wander south as refugees, into the foreign lands of Dunland, (where Rohan's enemies the Wild Men of Dunland lived).

Now it's a bit of a tangent, but I think it's worth mentioning that despite the movies portraying Thorin as barely ageing throughout these flashbacks, he was only 24 when Smaug sacked Erebor, which by Dwarven standards is very very young. And I think this is significant to his character because by the time of the Hobbit, Thorin is 195 years old. So he'd spent 171 years as a refugee. He was a prince and a king without a kingdom. All he had of Erebor were childhood memories from a lifetime ago.

Anyway, this is where things begin to heat up. Because as you can probably imagine, King Thrór was not happy about the multiple losses of his ancestral homelands, and he began to sink into a deep depression. Which certainly wasn't helped by the last of the Dwarven Rings that he still wore. So three years before the official outbreak of war, Thrór left his people, his ring, and the key to Erebor in Dunland with his son Thráin, and he set off with only one companion on a pilgrimage to the Great Gates of Durin the Deathless; the original entrance to the city of Khazad-dûm

Now Thrór and his companion Nár did successfully make it all the way over the Misty Mountains, and eventually they arrived in the Dimril Dale. Before them was Lake Mirrormere where Durin the Deathless had beheld the vision that inspired him to found Khazad-dûm in the first place. And beside the water's edge was the ancient Durin's Stone, which marked the spot where the first dwarf had stood and received this vision. So I imagine that from Thrór's perspective this must have been a bit like the culmination of a holy pilgrimage. Being the king of the Longbeards, Thrór decreed that Khazad-dûm was his by right, and that he was its heir. And furthermore the Great Gates were open. Surely this was a sign that the time had come for the Longbeards to reclaim Khazad-dûm. At least that's how Thrór saw it. However his companion Nár was more cautious.

So Nár begged Thrór to be aware of the dangers, and not to enter Moria alone. But Thrór was a king, and he refused to live without a kingdom any longer. So he passed through the Great Gate alone. And Nár awaited his return from the outside.

But Thrór never did come back.

You see inside Moria dwelt the infamous orc Azog. And I'm afraid there aren't too many details given about Azog other than his name. We don't know his age or his purpose in Moria, but it's very possible that he was a chieftain of those orcs sent by Sauron to populate Moria 310 years earlier. However we do know that he was one of the most important orcs in the North, and we also know that as far as the orcs were concerned, *he* was the King of Moria.

So after an unknown number of days waiting outside for his king, Nár eventually beheld a harrowing sight. King Thrór's headless body was flung out of the Great Gates, and his severed head immediately followed. Upon inspection, Nár found that across Thrór's forehead was branded the word AZOG in Cirth runes, and a moment later he was struck by purse containing *""few coins of little worth"".* The purse was thrown by Azog himself who allowed Nár to live simply so he could pass on the message to the rest of Durin's Folk. The implication of this macabre payment was clear. Azog would permit no future beggars to enter *his* kingdom, and he'd allow no others to declare themselves its king.

Now after thousands of years of ancestral conflict, this, the murder of King Thrór by the chieftain Azog, was the spark that eventually ignited the Dwarves and Orcs into a full-blown war.

You see when Thrór's son Thráin eventually learned from Nár what had happened to his father, he sat in silent contemplation for seven days, refusing to eat or to sleep. But, finally on the seventh day, Thráin arose from this throne and declared that *""this cannot be borne!""* And for the next three years, Thráin amassed what is probably the greatest Dwarven army ever assembled in Middle-earth's history. So Tolkien tells us that Thráin's host was *""joined by great forces sent from the Houses of other Fathers, for this dishonour...filled them with wrath,""* and this is an interesting detail because it implies that not only was Thráin's Longbeard army bolstered by Broadbeams and Firebeards of the West, but also potentially by the super mysterious Dwarves of the East. And when the Dwarven host was fully mustered, the great War of the Dwarves and Orcs began.

Now despite the length of this post, I'm afraid there's not a huge amount to say about the specific battles in this war. It mostly happened underground after all, and so neither Elven nor Mannish chroniclers ever truly learned the details of what happened. But what we can infer is that the Dwarves began in the North, and they systematically worked their way south cleansing the Misty Mountains as they went. And it seems that the first site the Dwarves reclaimed, was the first one they'd lost.

So 4537 years after Mount Gundabad was first sacked and populated by Sauron's orcs in the Second Age, the Dwarves of King Thráin finally re-conquered the holy mountain, and the orcs inside were slaughtered. Over the next six years, the Dwarven army moved south through the misty mountains, winning battle after battle ""*through their strength, and their matchless weapons, and the fire of their anger,""* until they finally arrived in the Dimril Dale. The very same place where Durin the Deathless had begun the founding of Khazad-dûm, and where Thrór's severed head had been cast out by Azog. Now in the Khuzdul language of the Dwarves, the Dimril Dale is known as Azanulbizar, and this was the name that was given to the epic battle that was fought here.

So, the Battle of Azanulbizar is that same battle that we see briefly in the first Hobbit movie, although Tolkien's telling of it differs significantly from Peter Jackson's. I mean to be fair, it is in this battle that a young Thorin (he was 54 at the time) used an oak branch as his shield and took up the epithet Oakenshield, which the movie does get right, but as we know Thrór was already dead when this battle started, Thràin was blinded in one eye, and perhaps the most significant change is the fate of Azog. Obviously in the movie he gets his arm cut off by Thorin and lives to fight another day, but in Tolkien's writings, this is completely different. It's not even Thorin who Azog fights.

Now, remember earlier when I mentioned Thrór's brother Grór founding a kingdom in the Iron Hills after the War of the Dwarves and Dragons, and I said these Dwarves would be important? Well it's in this battle that we see why. So, Grór has a grandson called Dáin Ironfoot, and Dáin is possibly my number one favourite dwarf in the entire Legendarium. He is utterly badass.

So Dáin Ironfoot, alongside his father Náin and the rest of the Dwarves from the Iron Hills, fought at Azanulbizar, and just like his cousin Thorin, Dáin achieved massive fame and acclaim in this battle. Now the Dwarves of the Iron Hills arrived late, and before they showed up it looked like the orcs might be victorious, but when they did finally arrive, they brought with them fresh reinforcements that turned the tide of battle. In fact Dáin's father Náin even fought his way all the way up to the Great Gate of Moria and demanded that Azog come out to fight him.

Now we're told that before this point in the battle, Azog hadn't yet emerged from Moria to risk his own life. But when Náin challenged him, he perceived that the time had come. So Azog emerged from the darkness, and he fought a one on one duel with Náin. Now Náin was a great warrior, and we can presume that he was a veteran of many battles, but when he faced Azog he was half blinded by rage. We're told that Náin swung at Azog with all his might, but the orc was nimble, and when Náin missed, Azog broke his neck. The King's cousin died instantly.

However despite Azog's personal victory, his orc army was routed and his guards were dead. So, like a coward, Azog turned towards the gate and tried to flee back inside Moria. But this didn't turn out the way he'd hoped. Dáin Ironfoot had just watched his father die at Azog's hand, and he had no intention of letting the orc escape to fight another day. So Dáin charged at Azog, and outside the gates of Moria he hewed the orc's head from his shoulders with his red axe. Now what's particularly nuts about all this is that Dáin Ironfoot was only 32 at the time. That may not sound especially young, but by Dwarven standards it really was. For comparison's sake, we're told that during the events of the Hobbit, Gimli the dwarf was too young to take part in the Quest of Erebor, being 15 years younger than their youngest member Kili. But Gimli was 62 when that happened. He was almost double the age of Dáin Ironfoot when Dáin killed Azog. Which makes Dáin an amazingly awesome young dwarf!

Anyway, after the Battle of Azanulbizar and the death of Azog, the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was declared over. Azog's severed head was impaled on a spike, and the same purse containing *""few coins of little worth""* was stuffed into his mouth. King Thrór was finally avenged. But the victory had come at a high cost. Although we're told that ten thousand orcs had been killed in the battle, the Dwarven dead were ""*beyond the count of grief.""* And although King Thráin sought to press his advantage and reclaim Moria once and for all, he was dissuaded by his nephew Dáin. You see while killing Azog, Dáin alone had looked into Moria, and he'd seen the shadow of Durin's Bane. In fact Dáin prophesied to the king that ""*some other power than ours must come before Durin's Folk walk again in Moria.""*

Now, on the one hand it would seem that this marks the end of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. However I would argue that although Azog's death begins a 142 year ceasefire, the conflict was not yet truly over. Because of course Azog is the only orc in the Legendarium who we're explicitly told has a son. And this son is another orc chieftain called Bolg. And Bolg would meet both Thorin and Dáin again before the very end.

So if we skip forward a century and a half from the Battle of Azanulbizar, Thráin's son Thorin Oakenshield will lead his Company to reclaim his grandfather's kingdom of Erebor from Smaug the dragon. Now this is pretty much the plot of the Hobbit, but of course once Erebor is reclaimed and the dragon is dead, there's one more battle that needs to be fought. And in the Battle of the Five Armies, Thorin and Bolg lead their respective forces once again to war. And once again, Dáin Ironfoot is there. And once again, Dáin Ironfoot watches a family member die in battle.

So with the eventual deaths of Thorin, Fili, and Kili, the line of Thrór is finally wiped out. But with the death of Bolg, so too is the line of Azog wiped out. And it would appear that with this, the war of the Dwarves and Orcs is finally ended.

But I would argue that there's one last epilogue, which brings this war full circle. Because to be honest upon reflection, this doesn't seem like a particularly happy ending. I mean Erebor once again belongs to the dwarves, and Dáin Ironfoot has taken his cousin's place as king, but Moria is still an orc stronghold, and at some point between the Battle of Azanulbizar and the Hobbit, orcs once again reclaim the holy mountain of Gundabad.

1328,lz2e43,I think a LOTR video game would be amazing.,"I know there are already LOTR video games. The best one being Return of the king, of course. But I mean there should be a brand new adaptation of the Books. A video game rendition, completely independent of Peter Jackson's (amazing!) Films. I'm thinking a sandbox level type of game that goes from the very beginning of the books, to the very end. The playable characters would change based on where you are in the game, but the main ones would be obvious: Frodo, Samwise (the real hero), Aragon, and Gandalf. The reason I believe this story would work so well in a video game is because you can make a video games story last 80+ hours.

The best one being Return of the king, of course. But I mean there should be a brand new adaptation of the Books. A video game rendition, completely independent of Peter Jackson's (amazing!) Films. I'm thinking a sandbox level type of game that goes from the very beginning of the books, to the very end. The playable characters would change based on where you are in the game, but the main ones would be obvious: Frodo, Samwise (the real hero), Aragon, and Gandalf. The reason I believe this story would work so well in a video game is because you can make a video games story last 80+ hours.

I really dislike such whining. Not all stories need realism (apparently these Tolkien critics haven't read the Silmarillion). And realism does not equal good. Can someone explain me, why do modern day ""progressives"" whine about realism and women in LOTR? 

P. S. I noticed that most ""progressive"" critics of Tolkien were men. I read the recent interview with Philip Pullman who was annoyed about the lack of women in LOTR. Ironically, he gave his female character the most sexist and, given her age, disturbing role possible and the ending of his story is terrible.

Do any of you guys want to sold the steam key for a reasonable price? I would gladly buy it! Thank you for any help."

1398,lxnpc1,Vinyl collection," Hi everyone  


In 2018, as many of you probably know, Reprise Records released box sets of the soundtracks of the movies on vinyl.  
Last year I discovered this and after a while I owned the complete set.  


The reason I am making a thread here is because I was wondering if there are some others who have the collection too. Up until now they were displayed in my study and last night I took a look at them and somehow, one had a scratch on it, it was really small but still visible. Here is a link so you can see for yourself: [https://imgur.com/a/0n8Z1nF](https://imgur.com/a/0n8Z1nF)

You see, I don't really know how to properly store/display them without them being damaged, since it is a really valuable collection to me. So I'm really looking for ways to make sure the cover (and the rest of the set) gets damaged at least as possible.  


I will happily listen to all your tips and tricks!

**---Overview---**

It is a Reddit favourite fact Tolkien once visited Lauterbrunnen, and that it inspired Rivendell [(evidence here)](http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/Rivimages/realriv.html). But he also did far more in his trip to Switzerland. I have found all the evidence I can on this and made suggestions on how it can be recreated either as easily or as closely as possible.

I am a fan of Tolkien, but not a superfan. I have never touched The Silmarillion, plus I had to look up most of the named places in this post. I am much more of a Switzerland-Nerd really. This started as a quick fact-check that grew rather out of hand….. 


---

* [Imgur album of the route and many of the places that are mentioned.](https://imgur.com/a/vSd9XRz)

---

**---The facts---**

Tolkien visited Switzerland in the summer (July/August) of 1911 at age of 19. He and his brother were taken by the Brookes-Smith family who his family was friends with (and his brother was working for on their farm at the time) and who sounded a wee bit eccentric. [They went as a very mixed party of 12 (with a local guide too) including his aunt Jane Neave who is often speculated as being a part of the inspiration for Gandalf.](https://imgur.com/zlvJUE4) 

There are three sources of information for this; Tolkien himself, Colin Brookes-Smith (CBS), and 3 dated documents. 

[Due to space limitations I have put a full version of the (relevant parts of) Tolkien’s letters and CBS’s information in a comment at the end of this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/ltlev4/jrr_tolkien_in_switzerland_v2/goyvt9f/) It is worth keeping in mind that Tolkien and CBS wrote their accounts over half a century later as old men remembering boyhood trips.

Tolkien:

* Most of the information from Tolkien himself comes from [Letter 306]( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_306) (1967) that he wrote to his son 56 years later at the age of 76. He describes the route and some events along the way. Some parts are clearly remembered and directly linked to places in the books, others are skipped over or rather more vague. So it is a little hard to figure it out exactly what he did (still not bad for a brief letter written so long after just being somewhere once). 


* [Letter 232]( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_232) (1961) has far less information on the trip but directly states that some of the events ended up in the Hobbit. 

Colin Brookes Smith (CBS) aged 12 at the time:

* In unpublished account of the trip CBS is said to contradict some of the more extravagant claims by Tolkien in his letters (eg: Tolkien claims to often slept rough in cowsheds or under the open sky, whilst CBS says they almost always found accommodation) but confirms some of the other points and adds some further details (Brookes-Smith, Colin. Some Reminiscences of J. R. R. Tolkien. Unpublished: Bloxham. 1982). 

* Being unpublished it is rather hard to see exactly what he said. The 2008 book ‘Tolkien’s Gedling’ by Andrew H. Morton seems to be the first to have published details from CBS, with the more recent 2020 ‘The worlds of JRR Tolkien’ by John Garth also includes some of these accounts. They mostly give an account of what he said rather than quoting directly.

* The Brookes-Smiths family made regular of trips to the Alps so it is possible that writing his memories of Tolkien 70 years later that he might have mixed up details of trips. However he is said to have a map of the trip that was filled in by an older member. 

There are also 3 exact places and dates that can be pinned down:

* [“5 August 1911  Tolkien’s name is written in the guest book of the Ober Steinberg Berg-Gasthaus in the Inner Lauterbrunnenthal, south of Interlaken.”]( http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology_by_date2.html).

* “On 17 August 1911, Tolkien's friend Christopher Wiseman replied to two cards received that day from Tolkien, who he said was 'on the other side of the valley' from Gletsch.” ‘Tolkien's Worlds: The Places That Inspired the Writer's Imagination’ By John Garth.

* [“25 August 1911  Tolkien signs the guest book at the Cabane de Bertol, above Arolla on the Col de Bertol (Bertol Pass). This is presumably the day trip to a high-altitude hut recalled by both Tolkien and Colin Brookes-Smith.”]( http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology_by_date2.html)

---

**---Interpreting the events---**

There is the question of how literally to take his letters and how much to read into what ends up in the books. It can be easy to read into everything and to start assigning connections to every little event or place. A number of enthusiastic people have invented parts of Tolkien’s adventures (saying he visited St Beatus caves or Gornergrat despite no evidence of that) or have even managed to make up some of their own translations (*“We descend into the Grindelwald (from an ancient Germanic word meaning mysterious forest)”*, no it is not). I have tried to be clear about what there is evidence for vs what they might have done.

Assigning real life and fiction one to one is a bad idea at the best of times, but especially so with Tolkien. To quote from John Garth’s ‘The Worlds of JRR Tolkien’ which is beautifully made and gives the most insightful and level headed approach to the topic that you will find anywhere.
 
&gt; *”Existing discussions of Tolkien’s place inspirations are often unsatisfactory. Most boil down to the circular argument that some wood mountain or river ‘must have’ inspired him because it looks ‘Tolkienesque’. Such assertions say little about Tolkien. Tourist offices and entrepreneurs often ignore or distort the biographical facts to serve local commercial interests, and their assertions acquire the air of fact by being repeated in newspapers and on Wikipedia. At the other extreme, some genuine Tolkien experts are better at identifying possible influences than judging their plausibility, producing a spaghetti of loose ends.”*

and 

&gt; *“His instinct was to dip, mix and layer, drawing from personal experience, reading and imagination - a touch from here, a hint from here, a flourish out of nowhere”*. 

Whilst it did influence him it is easy to overread into the landscape, in his biography written by a good friend of his less than 2 pages are given over to the trip. I think the films have also skewed the perception somewhat towards the Alpine landscape thanks to being shot in New Zealand. In reality Tolkien spent far more time in the gentler English landscape, [for example quoted by his biographer as comparing the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire with the white mountains between Gondor and Rohan](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29787528), which is quite different to the endless high and lonely peaks in the film where hardcore mountaineers manned the beacons (a beautiful scene but rather stupid really). 

Ultimately do and think whatever you like and make whatever you like of it, I just got curious about trying to figure out as exactly as possible what he actually did.


---

**---The route:---**

Just about all of the attention goes to Lauterbrunnen: being the touristy photogenic spot everyone likes to shout about Lauterbrunnen having the connection to him, but they did a bigger tour that certainly inspired other parts of his work.

Route (by train/boat up to Interlaken):

Birmingham – Harwich – Ostend – Cologne – Frankfurt (via a boat through the Upper Middle Rhine Valley Gorge) – Munich – Innsbruck – Interlaken – Lauterbrunnen – Mürren – Kleine Scheidegg – Grosse Scheidegg – Meiringen – Grimselpass – Brig – Belalp – Passes from St Niklaus though to Les Hauderes– Zermatt and/or Arolla – Sion – Homeward.

Google maps of the [rough route and places Tolkien mentions in Switzerland]( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1uhe23GA8U--BkxjCjqhLFBRBISafLBJI&amp;ll=46.48280056633507%2C7.6336742117187395&amp;z=9) and of [All the locations mentioned by Tolkien and CBS](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1nz_BRFoR-ow5eY1zUEMftGPJoxoJqQIA&amp;usp=sharing).

They certainly got about, and especially so if (as it sounds) they did it all by foot. By my estimate this is at least 315km with 20,000m of height gain. And that is ignoring possible side excursions which would add a fair bit more height change on. 

Hardcore seemed to be the order of the day going by [the diary of Miss Jemima Morrell who was one of the first package tourists to Switzerland.](https://radu.ch/historic-journeys-in-switzerland/jemima-morell/)

---

**---Then vs now:---**

Clearly 110 years is a long time. There has been change, but the sights and feel would still be recognisable.

You can use the [Swiss topographic map]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=en&amp;topic=ech&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;layers=ch.swisstopo.zeitreihen,ch.bfs.gebaeude_wohnungs_register,ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.swisstopo.swisstlm3d-wanderwege&amp;layers_visibility=true,false,false,false&amp;layers_timestamp=19111231,,,&amp;E=2636820.20&amp;N=1158892.93&amp;zoom=5&amp;layers_opacity=1,1,1,0.8&amp;swipe_ratio=0.49) with its time-jump feature (swipe back and forth) to see how the whole country looked in 1911 compared to now (or any other year from the mid 1800s if you change the settings). 

In short there was much more glacier, and far less buildings then. The increase in buildings and infrastructure (especially the ski infrastructure across the mountain meadows) since then would probably give Tolkien a heart attack and lead to comments about “The Scouring of the Schweiz”. Not to say they are ruined industrial landscapes, but there is much more humanity around now than then. The noise of traffic (especially motorbikes) on the pass roads would really upset him.

&gt; *”It is full Maytime by the trees and grass now. But the heavens are full of roar and riot. You cannot even hold a shouting conversation in the garden now, save about 1 a.m. and 7 p.m. – unless the day is too foul to be out. How I wish the 'infernal combustion' engine had never been invented.”* (Letter 64)

Switzerland was a tourist destination now and then, but the number of visitors and infrastructure serving them has vastly increased which contributes to the above. What then was a hard uphill hike to a hamlet that existed purely for grazing animals in the high meadows in summer is now an easy cable car ride up to year round villages which have massively expanded thanks to ski tourism. The view is still impressive but the feeling isn't the same. There are still many obscure and hard to reach little places in the Alps if you want to recreate that feeling.

There are still Tolkien friendly old rural style Shire-like ways, but mostly with a modern twist. You can still see generations of a family collecting their hay with rakes and scythes from the fields in summer, though often most of the work is done by special tractors except on the very steepest slopes. Cows still roam the meadows, though now electric wires keep them in the right place (still got the bells though). Farmers are even paid to keep historic elements like old fountains in good order.

---

**---Recreating this yourself:---**

You could do this as 2-3 weeks of pure hard hiking, or a few days of relaxed public transport rides along many of the same routes with no physical exertion (only the final stage in the high Valais is impossible to follow exactly by public transport). Much of it is safe and worry free unless you go for the hardest options, even then you are never that far from civilization for supplies or shelter.

You can also just easily visit a few of the places. The Jungfrau region at the start and Zermatt at the end are major international tourist destinations so getting in and around is very easy.

I have written about [hiking in Switzerland](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8qto9t/my_guide_and_tips_for_hiking_in_switzerland/), and also [Switzerland in general]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/85jbdn/resources_for_switzerland/) to quite an extensive degree before. My [post on the Jungfrau region]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/azds8v/my_guide_to_the_jungfrau_region/) also covers a the area around a fair few of the early stages.

Almost nobody has the time or energy to walk this whole thing in a perfect recreation, and frankly parts of this like Meiringen to the Grimselpass probably wouldn’t be much fun now. But if you do want to do what I am going to term “the full Hobbit”, then I have made a hiking map here for the whole thing up to the Bertol hut – [Link]( https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;land=wanderland&amp;route=all&amp;layers=Wanderland&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=5&amp;E=2606903&amp;N=1094911&amp;trackId=838090061). A 315 km hike with +20,000m / -17,000m height difference (more if you carry on from the  Bertol hut to Zermatt or down to Sion).

* The trip itself was made in July/August and the passes should be doable from late June, to early October (weather allowing).

* [There are actually guided tours with this theme](https://www.alpenwild.com/trip/in-the-footsteps-of-tolkien/overview/), but is cheaper (500CHF per day is insane) and easy enough to do it yourself. The footpath and transport system in Switzerland makes this very easy to plan and do. 

* There are endless adventurous diversions you can take along the way. I have only included the most relevant that are directly on the path and would have been possible back then. See the local tourist info for more ideas.

* Surprisingly the local tourist offices don't make much of a fuss about it (beyond a cut-out of Aragorn in Lauterbrunnen). I have never noticed any signs, theme walks, tourist tack or anything like it in the area, which is a little odd as the Swiss love their themed tourism (see the Mark Twain walks at [Rigi](https://www.rigi.ch/en/Experience-Enjoy/Summer/Hiking/Hiking-trails-on-Mount-Rigi/Mark-Twain-trail) and [Riffelberg](https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Planning-hikes-tours/Mark-Twain-Weg), and the milking of [James bond at Schilthorn](https://schilthorn.ch/en/Info/Piz_Gloria_2970_m_._9744_ft#bond_world)). About the only thing is [this page on the Jungfrau tourism website]( https://stories.jungfrauregion.swiss/en/story-tolkien) which is fairly well hidden. It starts out well, but then degrades into desperately trying to tie every tourist activity in the area to something from LOTR.

* Other than Arolla down to Sion This all takes place in the German speaking part of the country, in most places along the way English is widely spoken due to the tourism industry. High-German will function if you know it, just don’t expect to understand the Swiss-German you hear (especially in Valais). You can probably imagine that Swiss-German is a Middle-Earth based language…… [(if you do want to learn more about Swiss German then see this post)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/9levnb/my_experience_dealing_with_swissgerman_for_those/))

* It is important to remember the context that he came from a heavily industrial city in the gentle landscape of the UK Midlands, passing through other industrial cities along the way before arriving in the rural alpine valleys. You might want to visit a giant Chinese industrial city first for a few weeks to establish the right feeling on arrival.

**---Stages---**

I have broken this down into stages with suggestions for easy (but still enjoyable) and more authentic harder options.

---

**Stage 0: Getting there**

They took quite a roundabout route. Maybe they wanted the scenic route or maybe they just made it up as they went along. Taking the train from Munich to Innsbruck and then to Zürich is a very beautiful line.

For most people you could just fly to Zurich or Geneva and then take the train to Interlaken (with a change in Bern).

---

**Stage 1: Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen valley**


The most common comparison is that Lauterbrunnen valley is Rivendell. Tolkien himself never said this directly, but [this link provides various forms of evidence which strongly suggest it is at least a strong inspiration](http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/Rivimages/realriv.html). Although you wouldn’t mistake Swiss farmers for gossiping elves.

Letter 306:

&gt; *We went on foot carrying great packs practically all the way from Interlaken, mainly by mountain paths, to Lauterbrunnen and so to Mürren and eventually to the head of the Lauterbrunnenthal in a wilderness of morains.*

The Hobbit:

&gt; *“Here it is at last!” he called, and the others gathered round him and looked over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and there was a light on the valley-side across the water….. Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell.*

Route:

* Easy: Train from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, then to Mürren either by foot/bus along the valley floor and cable car up, or cable car to Grütschalp and train/walk along.

* Moderate: Train from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, wander up the valley to the Trummelbachfalle and back to Lauterbrunnen, then go up to Grütschalp and do [the mountain trail](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8saqke/hiking_from_lauterbrunnen_to_m%C3%BCrrengimmelwald_via/) to Mürren.

* Hard: If you want to take Tolkien and the Hobbit literally then to avoid the roads you can do mountain trails right out of Interlaken, up to Sulegg, and along to drop down into Lauterbrunnen. This fits with the book but would be a really hard start to the trip, it would however be a truly unique experience as the number of people doing this entry to the valley must be utterly tiny. You could do this all on foot as a 2 day hike [Link](https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=14.7&amp;E=2632775&amp;N=1165468&amp;trackId=5068223), or you can also take the bus from Wilderswil Bahnhof to Saxeten to reduce it down to a single day hike [Link]( https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=7.01&amp;E=2632859&amp;N=1162950&amp;trackId=5068225). Either way you would understand how Bilbo got so tired (and he had a pony too)..

More info:

* [I wrote about the Jungfrau area before in more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/azds8v/my_guide_to_the_jungfrau_region/).

* Interlaken has nothing of interest (unless you love hotels and tourist shops), don’t bother with it other than somewhere to sleep or change trains. Despite being between the lakes it is not on either so it doesn’t have a lakeside feel.

* [The building at the St Beaten caves near Interlaken looks like it fell out of picture of Rivendell]( https://i.redd.it/trz2bhox8q111.jpg) but are probably nothing to do with Tolkien. The site was a tourist spot then and it isn’t far from Interlaken so maybe he went (if he did he didn’t mention it). Apparently there is a part of it that dates back to the 1500s as a chapel, but as far as I can tell the structure is for the most part very modern and as likely to have been inspired by Tolkien as VV. Still the caves are pretty and there is a myth of a dragon residing in the area too. [My post on visiting there]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/862zkz/the_exceptionally_fairytale_like_castle_in_thun/).    

* The main iconic waterfall is the Staubbachfall which you can walk to from Lauterbrunnen village in 5 minutes (and go through a tunnel behind it for free in summer), more impressive but hidden (and not free) is the [Trummelbachfalls]( https://www.truemmelbachfaelle.ch/e/) which are about 30 minutes along the valley by foot (or an easy drive/bus ride). Tolkien made no mention of them however, but they have impressed people like Goethe and Byron. The marketing line [“the valley of 72 waterfalls”]( https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/valley-of-the-72-waterfalls-lauterbrunnen-stechelberg.html) has really stuck. Though just about any mountain valley will have lots of waterfalls, and unless it is actually raining you will have a hard time counting 72 (or even care about more than 10 of them).

* One especially mad fan wants to build a Rivendell theme park there (Google:  realrivendell wixsite) but the chance of success is going to be about 0% and it seems to be long dead.

---

**Stage 2: End of the Lauterbrunnental**

A hike up to the end of the valley.

Letter 306

&gt; *”We went on foot carrying great packs practically all the way from Interlaken, mainly by mountain paths, to Lauterbrunnen and so to Mürren and eventually to the head of the Lauterbrunnenthal in a wilderness of morains.”*

Source

&gt; [*“5 August 1911  Tolkien’s name is written in the guest book of the Ober Steinberg Berg-Gasthaus in the Inner Lauterbrunnenthal, south of Interlaken.”*]( http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology_by_date2.html).

Route:

* Easy: There isn’t any easy way to get to the Berggasthaus Obersteinberg. The easiest adventure at the end of the valley is taking the cable car up to Schilthorn.

* Hard: Mürren to Berggasthaus Obersteinberg via Tanzbedeli.

More info:

* The [Berggasthaus Obersteinberg]( http://www.stechelberg.ch/schlafen-und-essen/berghotel/berghotel-obersteinberg.html) is still there and can be reached by foot from Stechelberg (bus from Lauterbrunnen) or from Mürren/Gimmelwald. Either way the shortest roundtrip is 10km with +1000m and -1000m of height change. You can also stay overnight.

* Tolkien talks about the morrains, which some people link to the strenuous experience of Frodo climbing mount Doom (and having climbed plenty of similar places I can agree there). 

---

**Stage 3: Lauterbrunnen to Grindelwald**

Up and over the Kleine Scheidegg (smaller/lesser water divide).

Letter 306:

&gt; *We must then have gone eastward over the two Scheidegge to Grindelwald, with Eiger and Mönch on our right, and eventually reached Meiringen. I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret: eternal snow, etched as it seemed against eternal sunshine, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue: the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams.*

Route

* Easy: Train from Lauterbrunnen to Kleine Scheidegg, and then down to Grindelwald. The Lauterbrunnen-Kleine Scheidegg-Grindelwald pass line opened in 1893 and was electrified before Tolkien arrived so it is an authentic option.

* Hard: Hike (19km, +/- 1400/1150m), [it is stage 11 of the Via-Alpina route](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/etappe-01560.html). However the Lauterbrunnen-Kleine Scheidegg-Grindelwald mountain trains present an escape option if you get too tired at any point, or want to cut the length down.

More info:

* The view of the Silberhorn which you get from Kleine Scheidegg [(a secondary peak of the Jungfrau)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silberhorn)) really stuck with Tolkien. He called it ""the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams"" (the peak with the tower where the Gandalf-Balrog fight ends, I had to look it up too).

* Go via Wengen for [the classic view up the valley](https://imgur.com/ykLg8sT
).

* An obvious diversion here would be taking the train to [Jungfraujoch]( https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfraujoch-top-of-europe/). This opened in 1912 after Tolkien passed by, but they had partial service to the Eiger and Eismeer windows before then, so he could have gone part way up though it seems likely he would have said so given how unique an experience it would have been.


---


**Stage 4: Grindelwald to Meiringen.**

Up and down over the Grosse Scheidegg pass (car free, bar the odd bus).

Source (letter 306)

&gt; We must then have gone eastward over the two Scheidegge to Grindelwald, with Eiger and Mönch on our right, and eventually reached Meiringen.

Route:

* Easy: Bus 128 from Grindelwald to Schwarzwaldalp, then Bus 148 down to Meiringen.

Moderate. Hike down to Rosenlaui or better yet a bit further to

* Hard: hike (23km, +/- 1100/1500m), [it is marked as stage 10 of the Via-Alpina route](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/etappe-01559.html), it could also make a very good 2 day hike with an overnight at the Rosenlaui.

More info:

* This passes by the [Hotel Rosenlaui](https://rosenlaui.ch/en/Welcome) , a belle-epoque style hotel which dates back to 1905 or older and has been kept as authentically as possible. [I stayed there in 2020 and wrote about the hotel and area around the Grosse Scheidegg in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/hmeujk/a_week_hiking_around_fiesch_and_rosenlaui/).

* The Grosse Scheidegg is much quieter, less developed, and at times more wild feeling than the Kleine Scheidegg which is much more touristy and is covered with ski infrastructure. 

* In the final approach to Meiningen you pass by the [Reichenbachfalls]( https://www.grimselwelt.ch/en/transport-lift/reichenbachfall) of Sherlock Holmes fame (not bad falls, but far from the best around). The funicular there opened in 1899 and it is very likely that at least someone in the party would have wanted to see it. 

* On which note the whole Sherlock Holmes theme to Meiringen is really surreal. Otherwise Meiringen is pleasant enough but nothing exciting (though it does claim to be home to the Meringue). 

---

**Stage 5: Meiringen to Brig.**

Up the Grimselpass, then down via Obergoms.

Letter 306:

&gt; *We later crossed the Grimsell Pass down on to the dusty highway, beside the Rhone, on which horse 'diligences' still plied: but not for us. We reached Brig on foot, a mere memory of noise : then a network of trams that screeched on their rails for it seemed at least 20 hrs of the day.*

Source

* *“On 17 August 1911, Tolkien's friend Christopher Wiseman replied to two cards received that day from Tolkien, who he said was 'on the other side of the valley' from Gletsch.”* ‘Tolkien's Worlds: The Places That Inspired the Writer's Imagination’ By John Garth.

Route:

* Easy: Bus 161 from Meiringen to Oberwald, then train down to Brig. Or a faster but less authentic (still scenic) option is taking the train to Brig via Interlaken and Spiez.

* Hard: Hike. This is about 73km with 2000m of height gain and loss. That combined with the first half being right next to a popular pass-road makes me suggest that walking the whole thing wouldn’t be the best idea.

More info:

* The section from Innertkirchen to Oberwald is one of the few places I have yet to visit.

* The [Aare gorge]( https://www.aareschlucht.ch/) just outside Meiringen opened to tourists in 1888 (and was actually more extensive then) and Tolkien would have had to have walked through or near it. Everyone seems keen to compare it to the rapids in Fellowship but he had also just actually taken a boat through the Rhine gorge in Germany which might also have played a big part there.

* Quite a bit would have changed along this section: big dams have been built by the pass with pylons taking the energy they generate down the valley, road has also opened up to much more tourist traffic and is a very popular tour for motorbikes.

* During warmer months a Postbus (#161) runs from Meiringen to Oberwald. From there you can take the train down to Brig. However the bus only runs twice a day or so, so you can’t hop on and off wherever it takes your fancy sadly. 

* If you do want to walk some of it I would suggest doing that in the Obergoms area which is a beautiful valley with meadows and small (mostly wooden and rustic) villages. For example [from Gluringen to Fiesch (via the suspension bridge)]( https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=12.05&amp;E=2657243&amp;N=1142185&amp;trackId=5169084).

* Brig is in my experience fairly forgettable. The old town is small but pleasant, and the Stockalper Schloss is pretty enough. Tolkien talks of “screeching trams”, I presume he meant the trains which were running down the valley then as Brig doesn’t seem to have ever had a tram network.

---

**Stage 6: Around the Aletsch glacier.**

Up the mountainside to the foot of the mighty glacier (all car free up there) where you can quite easily get at least a bit of the way into the UNESCO region. This actually gets most of Tolkien’s attention but is often overlooked in favour of the more popular Jungfrau region and Zermatt.

letter 306:

&gt;  *We climbed up some thousands of feet to a village at the foot of the Aletsch glacier, and there spent some nights in a châlet inn under a roof and in beds*

Letter 232:

&gt; *It was approaching the Aletsch that we were nearly destroyed by boulders loosened in the sun rolling down a snow-slope. An enormous rock in fact passed between me and the next in front. That and the 'thunder-battle' – a bad night in which we lost our way and slept in a cattle-shed – appear in The Hobbit.*

Route

* Easy: Take a cable car up to one of the villages like Riederalp/Bettmeralp/Fiescheralp and then a second cable car to the ridge with views down onto the Aletsch glacier. A very easy day-trip.

* Moderate: Cable car up and then some or all of the [Aletsch Panoramaweg](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/route-039.html).

* Hard: Hike all the way up from Brig and make a glacier tour.

More info:

* It seems that the village they stayed at was Belalp. The [Hotel Belalp](https://www.hotel-belalp.ch/hotel-belalp#10) has been there since 1856 so it is possible the group passed by or even stayed there.

* Otherwise maybe for the actual foot of the glacier “Oberer Aletsch” or “üssers Aletschi” would fit, but they are literally a few remote Alp sheds so are not the best option (or if you are hardcore they might actually be the best option). Eggen would also have been close to the glacier and remains quite small. After that Bealp or Riederalp are much more practical with shops and cable car access. Access around there via train and cable car is easy from Brig or anywhere else on the valley floor.


* [I have written more about the Aletsch region in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/hmeujk/a_week_hiking_around_fiesch_and_rosenlaui/).

* The Aletsch Glacier is one of the biggest highlights of Switzerland. It is hard to stress just how big it is ([the little blips at the front bottom are people]( https://i.imgur.com/e1QW3Ss.jpg)) The best viewing point is from the Eggishorn. [You can take the cable car up then hike alongside the glacier to Bettmeralp]( https://imgur.com/a/3AqlB). 

* The Aletsch Wald (a forest growing amongst glacially carved rocks) is beautiful and in part eerie. The hike [from Riederalp to Belalp or VV via the suspension bridge is fantastic](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/route-0150.html) (11km +/- 700/880). Or just drop down from Riederalp where it starts quite close to the village. The first time I went to do this hike a thunderstorm swept in and I found myself very quickly returning back to Riederalp. This route would have been partially under the glacier in 1911.

* A guide or skills and equipment are needed if you want to go on the glacier itself.


---

**Stage 7: High Valais.**

Things get a bit confused here with CBS and Tolkien seeming to disagree on the route.

CBS:

&gt; Based on a route marked on a map by an older member of the group CBS gives the route as: Visp - Stalden - St Niklaus - Gruben - Forcletta pass - Grimenz - Hauderes - Arolla. He isn’t reported as mentioning Zermatt but seems less sure after what they did in Arolla saying that “we must have walked down the Val d’Herens to Sion”.

Letter 306:

&gt; *After this we went on into Valais, and my memories are less clear; though I remember our arrival, bedraggled, one evening in Zermatt and the lorgnette stares of the French bourgeoises dames. We climbed with guides up to [a] high hut of the Alpine Club, roped (or I should have fallen into a snow-crevasse), and I remember the dazzling whiteness of the tumbled snow-desert between us and the black horn of the Matterhom some miles away.*

Source:

&gt; *25 August 1911 Tolkien signs the guest book at the Cabane de Bertol, above Arolla on the Col de Bertol (Bertol Pass). This is presumably the day trip to a high-altitude hut recalled by both Tolkien and Colin Brookes-Smith.*

It is possible that (1) they followed the route given by CBS and then over the glaciers to Zermatt (you would certainly be bedraggled after that), or (2) went up to Zermatt first then back down to St Niklaus and through the passes and up to Arolla, or (3) it could be that one or both of the accounts is wrong/incomplete.

Route:

* Easy: Train to Zermatt and then go up to Gornergrat. You can also reach Arolla by bus from Sion.

* Moderate: Some of the passes, or there are plenty of hikes around Zermatt and Arolla.

* Hard: There is plenty of room for the hard option here. The route described by CBS from Stalden up to Arolla then the Cabane de Bertol crosses 3 passes and is a rather hardcore 92km with +7500m / -5000m. From Zermatt to the Cabane de Bertol and then down to Arolla. There is no path and this involves crossing a glacier. The last part is for experts or those with a qualified guide only.

More info:

* Tolkien signed the guest book at the [Cabane de Bertol](https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts-and-tours/sac-route-portal/cabane-de-bertol-cas-2147000031/mountain-hiking/). Which on a rocky outcrop at 3311m is one the higher and more exposed huts in Switzerland. There is no easy way to get there, the approach from nearby Arolla is quite tough being 1300m of height over 8km, including a glacier/ice crossing even in summer.

* There are various options for a similar experience. I am going to pick Gornergrat for this. You can hike up there, or take the train up from Zermatt (the fully electric train opened in 1898). The height at 3089m is similar and you are surrounded by high peaks and glaciers.

* The CBS valley hopping route is the biggest section of the trip that can’t be directly covered with public transport.

* Given how much parts of the trip seem to translate directly to the Hobbit you might see it that the Matterhorn is the Lonely Mountain reached at the end of a long and perilous journey. Though he never said that himself and clearly it is lacking a lake, and isn’t THAT lonely, so (like with most things Tolkien) the inspiration wouldn’t be 100% direct.

* Once in Zermatt itself you have plenty of hiking and other activities to do. [I have written about it before too]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8t38ph/report_my_first_time_in_zermatt_switzerland/).

* I have been meaning to visit Arolla and do some of the passes described by CBS for a while, but it was only recently that I learned this part of  the itinerary, so sadly I can’t provide any advice there.

* Mark Twain also came to Zermatt, his ascent of the Riffelberg and to Gornergrat in ‘A Tramp Abroad’ is well worth a read.

---

**Stage 8: Homeward**

CBS: 

&gt; “we must have walked down the Val d’Herens to Sion”.

Whether they ended up in Arolla or Zermat they would have gone down to the main Rhone valley in Valais. 

Other than a long walk down you can take the bus from Arolla down to Sion, or the train from Zermatt to Visp. Both ways put you on the main train line with connections on to Geneva and Zürich.

---

**---How I would do this---**

If I ever find myself out of work during the summer I will take a few months to recreate the whole thing and write a book about it.

If that was too much info and you just want a fixed plan then this is what I would suggest for 10-14 days (for shorter time frames you could use public transport to skip whole sections). This is full on, so add a rest day in as you like. 

* Day 1: Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen by train. Walk along the valley to the Trummelbachfalls, double back to Lauterrunnen, take the cable car to Grütschalp and then the Mountain Trail hike to Mürren.

* Day 2: End of valley hike.

* Day 3: Hike over the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald. (Shortcut up or down with train)

* Day 4: Hike over the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. (shortcut with bus)

* Day 5: Meiringen to Brig via bus and train. Hike along a section of the Obergoms (eg: Gluringen to Fiesch).

* Day 6: Cable car up to Eggishorn, admire the glacier and follow the path along to Bettmeralp.

* Day 7: Hike from Rideralp to Belalp via the Aletsch forest.

* Day 8: Train to Zermatt. Take a gentle hike up to Zmutt.

* Day 9: Zermatt. [Take the train to Gornergrat and adventure along the ridge]( https://imgur.com/a/hpBbT).

* Day 10: Zermatt. [Hike the Edelweissweg](https://imgur.com/a/7aDNa).

You could then spend a day or two travelling to Chur and visit the Greisinger museum. Though I would try and avoid the Glacier Express and take local trains myself. Stop off at places like the Rhine gorge to make the most of it.


---

**---Misc---**

* It is a bit out the way of this route, and nowhere near where Tolkien himself went, but the [Greisinger Museum]( http://www.greisinger.museum/en/) sounds like it is worth checking out. Basically a dedicated/mad Swiss bloke made a museum containing Hobbit-hole near Chur. You can book tours by language on their website. At 50CHF it isn’t cheap (but is still cheaper than Hobbiton in NZ).

* [Villa Vals is often posted as the Swiss Hobbit House]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/frd4gy/villa_vals_the_often_posted_hobbit_house_of/), though it is far too exposed and concrete to really look like that.

* It is said in his biography that at some point in the trip Tolkien bought of postcard of [“Der Berggeist” by Josef Madlener]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Der_Berggeist.jpg) which he kept and later wrote on it “origin of Gandalf”. However the daughter of the artist says the painting was most likely done in the period 1925-1930, so he probably didn’t pick it up in Switzerland.

* Tolkien never went anywhere near it, but Appenzell is basically the shire as much as it can be found in Switzerland today  (in as much as a part of Swizterland can be like the English Midlands.). A very traditional rural area (women in Appenzell Innerrhoden couldn’t vote on local issues until 1991) that is worth a few days to explore.

**---Overview---**

It is a Reddit favourite fact Tolkien once visited Lauterbrunnen, and that it inspired Rivendell [(evidence here)](http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/Rivimages/realriv.html). But he also did far more in his trip to Switzerland. I have found all the evidence I can on this and made suggestions on how it can be recreated either as easily or as closely as possible.

I am a fan of Tolkien, but not a superfan. I have never touched The Silmarillion, plus I had to look up most of the named places in this post. I am much more of a Switzerland-Nerd really. This started as a quick fact-check that grew rather out of hand…..

* [Imgur album of the route and many of the places that are mentioned.](https://imgur.com/a/vSd9XRz)

**---The facts---**

Tolkien visited Switzerland in the summer (July/August) of 1911 at age of 19. He and his brother were taken by the Brookes-Smith family who his family was friends with (and his brother was working for on their farm at the time) and who sounded a wee bit eccentric. [They went as a very mixed party of 12 (with a local guide too) including his aunt Jane Neave who is often speculated as being a part of the inspiration for Gandalf.](https://imgur.com/zlvJUE4) 

There are three sources of information for this; Tolkien himself, Colin Brookes-Smith (CBS), and 3 dated documents. 

[Due to space limitations I have put a full version of the (relevant parts of) Tolkien’s letters and CBS’s information in a comment at the end of this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/ltlev4/jrr_tolkien_in_switzerland_v2/goyvt9f/) It is worth keeping in mind that Tolkien and CBS wrote their accounts over half a century later as old men remembering boyhood trips.

Tolkien:

* Most of the information from Tolkien himself comes from [Letter 306]( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_306) (1967) that he wrote to his son 56 years later at the age of 76. He describes the route and some events along the way. Some parts are clearly remembered and directly linked to places in the books, others are skipped over or rather more vague. So it is a little hard to figure it out exactly what he did (still not bad for a brief letter written so long after just being somewhere once). 


* [Letter 232]( http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_232) (1961) has far less information on the trip but directly states that some of the events ended up in the Hobbit. 

Colin Brookes Smith (CBS) aged 12 at the time:

* In unpublished account of the trip CBS is said to contradict some of the more extravagant claims by Tolkien in his letters (eg: Tolkien claims to often slept rough in cowsheds or under the open sky, whilst CBS says they almost always found accommodation) but confirms some of the other points and adds some further details (Brookes-Smith, Colin. Some Reminiscences of J. R. R. Tolkien. Unpublished: Bloxham. 1982). 

* Being unpublished it is rather hard to see exactly what he said. The 2008 book ‘Tolkien’s Gedling’ by Andrew H. Morton seems to be the first to have published details from CBS, with the more recent 2020 ‘The worlds of JRR Tolkien’ by John Garth also includes some of these accounts. They mostly give an account of what he said rather than quoting directly.

* The Brookes-Smiths family made regular of trips to the Alps so it is possible that writing his memories of Tolkien 70 years later that he might have mixed up details of trips. However he is said to have a map of the trip that was filled in by an older member. 

There are also 3 exact places and dates that can be pinned down:

* [“5 August 1911  Tolkien’s name is written in the guest book of the Ober Steinberg Berg-Gasthaus in the Inner Lauterbrunnenthal, south of Interlaken.”]( http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology_by_date2.html).

* “On 17 August 1911, Tolkien's friend Christopher Wiseman replied to two cards received that day from Tolkien, who he said was 'on the other side of the valley' from Gletsch.” ‘Tolkien's Worlds: The Places That Inspired the Writer's Imagination’ By John Garth.

* [“25 August 1911  Tolkien signs the guest book at the Cabane de Bertol, above Arolla on the Col de Bertol (Bertol Pass). This is presumably the day trip to a high-altitude hut recalled by both Tolkien and Colin Brookes-Smith.”]( http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology_by_date2.html)

---

**---Interpreting the events---**

There is the question of how literally to take his letters and how much to read into what ends up in the books. It can be easy to read into everything and to start assigning connections to every little event or place. A number of enthusiastic people have invented parts of Tolkien’s adventures (saying he visited St Beatus caves or Gornergrat despite no evidence of that) or have even managed to make up some of their own translations (*“We descend into the Grindelwald (from an ancient Germanic word meaning mysterious forest)”*, no it is not). I have tried to be clear about what there is evidence for vs what they might have done.

Assigning real life and fiction one to one is a bad idea at the best of times, but especially so with Tolkien. To quote from John Garth’s ‘The Worlds of JRR Tolkien’ which is beautifully made and gives the most insightful and level headed approach to the topic that you will find anywhere.
 
&gt; *”Existing discussions of Tolkien’s place inspirations are often unsatisfactory. Most boil down to the circular argument that some wood mountain or river ‘must have’ inspired him because it looks ‘Tolkienesque’. Such assertions say little about Tolkien. Tourist offices and entrepreneurs often ignore or distort the biographical facts to serve local commercial interests, and their assertions acquire the air of fact by being repeated in newspapers and on Wikipedia. At the other extreme, some genuine Tolkien experts are better at identifying possible influences than judging their plausibility, producing a spaghetti of loose ends.”*

and 

&gt; *“His instinct was to dip, mix and layer, drawing from personal experience, reading and imagination - a touch from here, a hint from here, a flourish out of nowhere”*. 

Whilst it did influence him it is easy to overread into the landscape, in his biography written by a good friend of his less than 2 pages are given over to the trip. I think the films have also skewed the perception somewhat towards the Alpine landscape thanks to being shot in New Zealand. In reality Tolkien spent far more time in the gentler English landscape, [for example quoted by his biographer as comparing the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire with the white mountains between Gondor and Rohan](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29787528), which is quite different to the endless high and lonely peaks in the film where hardcore mountaineers manned the beacons (a beautiful scene but rather stupid really). 

Ultimately do and think whatever you like and make whatever you like of it, I just got curious about trying to figure out as exactly as possible what he actually did.


---

**---The route:---**

Just about all of the attention goes to Lauterbrunnen: being the touristy photogenic spot everyone likes to shout about Lauterbrunnen having the connection to him, but they did a bigger tour that certainly inspired other parts of his work.

Route (by train/boat up to Interlaken):

Birmingham – Harwich – Ostend – Cologne – Frankfurt (via a boat through the Upper Middle Rhine Valley Gorge) – Munich – Innsbruck – Interlaken – Lauterbrunnen – Mürren – Kleine Scheidegg – Grosse Scheidegg – Meiringen – Grimselpass – Brig – Belalp – Passes from St Niklaus though to Les Hauderes– Zermatt and/or Arolla – Sion – Homeward.

Google maps of the [rough route and places Tolkien mentions in Switzerland]( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1uhe23GA8U--BkxjCjqhLFBRBISafLBJI&amp;ll=46.48280056633507%2C7.6336742117187395&amp;z=9) and of [All the locations mentioned by Tolkien and CBS](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1nz_BRFoR-ow5eY1zUEMftGPJoxoJqQIA&amp;usp=sharing).

They certainly got about, and especially so if (as it sounds) they did it all by foot. By my estimate this is at least 315km with 20,000m of height gain. And that is ignoring possible side excursions which would add a fair bit more height change on. 

Hardcore seemed to be the order of the day going by [the diary of Miss Jemima Morrell who was one of the first package tourists to Switzerland.](https://radu.ch/historic-journeys-in-switzerland/jemima-morell/)

---

**---Then vs now:---**

Clearly 110 years is a long time. There has been change, but the sights and feel would still be recognisable.

You can use the [Swiss topographic map]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=en&amp;topic=ech&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;layers=ch.swisstopo.zeitreihen,ch.bfs.gebaeude_wohnungs_register,ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.swisstopo.swisstlm3d-wanderwege&amp;layers_visibility=true,false,false,false&amp;layers_timestamp=19111231,,,&amp;E=2636820.20&amp;N=1158892.93&amp;zoom=5&amp;layers_opacity=1,1,1,0.8&amp;swipe_ratio=0.49) with its time-jump feature (swipe back and forth) to see how the whole country looked in 1911 compared to now (or any other year from the mid 1800s if you change the settings). 

In short there was much more glacier, and far less buildings then. The increase in buildings and infrastructure (especially the ski infrastructure across the mountain meadows) since then would probably give Tolkien a heart attack and lead to comments about “The Scouring of the Schweiz”. Not to say they are ruined industrial landscapes, but there is much more humanity around now than then. The noise of traffic (especially motorbikes) on the pass roads would really upset him.

&gt; *”It is full Maytime by the trees and grass now. But the heavens are full of roar and riot. You cannot even hold a shouting conversation in the garden now, save about 1 a.m. and 7 p.m. – unless the day is too foul to be out. How I wish the 'infernal combustion' engine had never been invented.”* (Letter 64)

Switzerland was a tourist destination now and then, but the number of visitors and infrastructure serving them has vastly increased which contributes to the above. What then was a hard uphill hike to a hamlet that existed purely for grazing animals in the high meadows in summer is now an easy cable car ride up to year round villages which have massively expanded thanks to ski tourism. The view is still impressive but the feeling isn't the same. There are still many obscure and hard to reach little places in the Alps if you want to recreate that feeling.

There are still Tolkien friendly old rural style Shire-like ways, but mostly with a modern twist. You can still see generations of a family collecting their hay with rakes and scythes from the fields in summer, though often most of the work is done by special tractors except on the very steepest slopes. Cows still roam the meadows, though now electric wires keep them in the right place (still got the bells though). Farmers are even paid to keep historic elements like old fountains in good order.

---

**---Recreating this yourself:---**

You could do this as 2-3 weeks of pure hard hiking, or a few days of relaxed public transport rides along many of the same routes with no physical exertion (only the final stage in the high Valais is impossible to follow exactly by public transport). Much of it is safe and worry free unless you go for the hardest options, even then you are never that far from civilization for supplies or shelter.

You can also just easily visit a few of the places. The Jungfrau region at the start and Zermatt at the end are major international tourist destinations so getting in and around is very easy.

I have written about [hiking in Switzerland](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8qto9t/my_guide_and_tips_for_hiking_in_switzerland/), and also [Switzerland in general]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/85jbdn/resources_for_switzerland/) to quite an extensive degree before. My [post on the Jungfrau region]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/azds8v/my_guide_to_the_jungfrau_region/) also covers a the area around a fair few of the early stages.

Almost nobody has the time or energy to walk this whole thing in a perfect recreation, and frankly parts of this like Meiringen to the Grimselpass probably wouldn’t be much fun now. But if you do want to do what I am going to term “the full Hobbit”, then I have made a hiking map here for the whole thing up to the Bertol hut – [Link]( https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;land=wanderland&amp;route=all&amp;layers=Wanderland&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=5&amp;E=2606903&amp;N=1094911&amp;trackId=838090061). A 315 km hike with +20,000m / -17,000m height difference (more if you carry on from the  Bertol hut to Zermatt or down to Sion).

* The trip itself was made in July/August and the passes should be doable from late June, to early October (weather allowing).

* [There are actually guided tours with this theme](https://www.alpenwild.com/trip/in-the-footsteps-of-tolkien/overview/), but is cheaper (500CHF per day is insane) and easy enough to do it yourself. The footpath and transport system in Switzerland makes this very easy to plan and do. 

* There are endless adventurous diversions you can take along the way. I have only included the most relevant that are directly on the path and would have been possible back then. See the local tourist info for more ideas.

* Surprisingly the local tourist offices don't make much of a fuss about it (beyond a cut-out of Aragorn in Lauterbrunnen). I have never noticed any signs, theme walks, tourist tack or anything like it in the area, which is a little odd as the Swiss love their themed tourism (see the Mark Twain walks at [Rigi](https://www.rigi.ch/en/Experience-Enjoy/Summer/Hiking/Hiking-trails-on-Mount-Rigi/Mark-Twain-trail) and [Riffelberg](https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Planning-hikes-tours/Mark-Twain-Weg), and the milking of [James bond at Schilthorn](https://schilthorn.ch/en/Info/Piz_Gloria_2970_m_._9744_ft#bond_world)). About the only thing is [this page on the Jungfrau tourism website]( https://stories.jungfrauregion.swiss/en/story-tolkien) which is fairly well hidden. It starts out well, but then degrades into desperately trying to tie every tourist activity in the area to something from LOTR.

* Other than Arolla down to Sion This all takes place in the German speaking part of the country, in most places along the way English is widely spoken due to the tourism industry. High-German will function if you know it, just don’t expect to understand the Swiss-German you hear (especially in Valais). You can probably imagine that Swiss-German is a Middle-Earth based language…… [(if you do want to learn more about Swiss German then see this post)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/9levnb/my_experience_dealing_with_swissgerman_for_those/))

* It is important to remember the context that he came from a heavily industrial city in the gentle landscape of the UK Midlands, passing through other industrial cities along the way before arriving in the rural alpine valleys. You might want to visit a giant Chinese industrial city first for a few weeks to establish the right feeling on arrival.

---

**---Stages---**

I have broken this down into stages with suggestions for easy (but still enjoyable) and more authentic harder options.

---

**Stage 0: Getting there**

They took quite a roundabout route. Maybe they wanted the scenic route or maybe they just made it up as they went along. Taking the train from Munich to Innsbruck and then to Zürich is a very beautiful line.

For most people you could just fly to Zurich or Geneva and then take the train to Interlaken (with a change in Bern).

---

**Stage 1: Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen valley**


The most common comparison is that Lauterbrunnen valley is Rivendell. Tolkien himself never said this directly, but [this link provides various forms of evidence which strongly suggest it is at least a strong inspiration](http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/Rivimages/realriv.html). Although you wouldn’t mistake Swiss farmers for gossiping elves.

Letter 306:

&gt; *We went on foot carrying great packs practically all the way from Interlaken, mainly by mountain paths, to Lauterbrunnen and so to Mürren and eventually to the head of the Lauterbrunnenthal in a wilderness of morains.*

The Hobbit:

&gt; *“Here it is at last!” he called, and the others gathered round him and looked over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and there was a light on the valley-side across the water….. Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell.*

Route:

* Easy: Train from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, then to Mürren either by foot/bus along the valley floor and cable car up, or cable car to Grütschalp and train/walk along.

* Moderate: Train from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, wander up the valley to the Trummelbachfalle and back to Lauterbrunnen, then go up to Grütschalp and do [the mountain trail](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8saqke/hiking_from_lauterbrunnen_to_m%C3%BCrrengimmelwald_via/) to Mürren.

* Hard: If you want to take Tolkien and the Hobbit literally then to avoid the roads you can do mountain trails right out of Interlaken, up to Sulegg, and along to drop down into Lauterbrunnen. This fits with the book but would be a really hard start to the trip, it would however be a truly unique experience as the number of people doing this entry to the valley must be utterly tiny. You could do this all on foot as a 2 day hike [Link](https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=14.7&amp;E=2632775&amp;N=1165468&amp;trackId=5068223), or you can also take the bus from Wilderswil Bahnhof to Saxeten to reduce it down to a single day hike [Link]( https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=7.01&amp;E=2632859&amp;N=1162950&amp;trackId=5068225). Either way you would understand how Bilbo got so tired (and he had a pony too)..

More info:

* [I wrote about the Jungfrau area before in more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/azds8v/my_guide_to_the_jungfrau_region/).

* Interlaken has nothing of interest (unless you love hotels and tourist shops), don’t bother with it other than somewhere to sleep or change trains. Despite being between the lakes it is not on either so it doesn’t have a lakeside feel.

* [The building at the St Beaten caves near Interlaken looks like it fell out of picture of Rivendell]( https://i.redd.it/trz2bhox8q111.jpg) but are probably nothing to do with Tolkien. The site was a tourist spot then and it isn’t far from Interlaken so maybe he went (if he did he didn’t mention it). Apparently there is a part of it that dates back to the 1500s as a chapel, but as far as I can tell the structure is for the most part very modern and as likely to have been inspired by Tolkien as VV. Still the caves are pretty and there is a myth of a dragon residing in the area too. [My post on visiting there]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/862zkz/the_exceptionally_fairytale_like_castle_in_thun/).    

* The main iconic waterfall is the Staubbachfall which you can walk to from Lauterbrunnen village in 5 minutes (and go through a tunnel behind it for free in summer), more impressive but hidden (and not free) is the [Trummelbachfalls]( https://www.truemmelbachfaelle.ch/e/) which are about 30 minutes along the valley by foot (or an easy drive/bus ride). Tolkien made no mention of them however, but they have impressed people like Goethe and Byron. The marketing line [“the valley of 72 waterfalls”]( https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/valley-of-the-72-waterfalls-lauterbrunnen-stechelberg.html) has really stuck. Though just about any mountain valley will have lots of waterfalls, and unless it is actually raining you will have a hard time counting 72 (or even care about more than 10 of them).

* One especially mad fan wants to build a Rivendell theme park there (Google:  realrivendell wixsite) but the chance of success is going to be about 0% and it seems to be long dead.

---

**Stage 2: End of the Lauterbrunnental**

A hike up to the end of the valley.

Letter 306

&gt; *”We went on foot carrying great packs practically all the way from Interlaken, mainly by mountain paths, to Lauterbrunnen and so to Mürren and eventually to the head of the Lauterbrunnenthal in a wilderness of morains.”*

Source

&gt; [*“5 August 1911  Tolkien’s name is written in the guest book of the Ober Steinberg Berg-Gasthaus in the Inner Lauterbrunnenthal, south of Interlaken.”*]( http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology_by_date2.html).

Route:

* Easy: There isn’t any easy way to get to the Berggasthaus Obersteinberg. The easiest adventure at the end of the valley is taking the cable car up to Schilthorn.

* Hard: Mürren to Berggasthaus Obersteinberg via Tanzbedeli.

More info:

* The [Berggasthaus Obersteinberg]( http://www.stechelberg.ch/schlafen-und-essen/berghotel/berghotel-obersteinberg.html) is still there and can be reached by foot from Stechelberg (bus from Lauterbrunnen) or from Mürren/Gimmelwald. Either way the shortest roundtrip is 10km with +1000m and -1000m of height change. You can also stay overnight.

* Tolkien talks about the morrains, which some people link to the strenuous experience of Frodo climbing mount Doom (and having climbed plenty of similar places I can agree there). 

---

**Stage 3: Lauterbrunnen to Grindelwald**

Up and over the Kleine Scheidegg (smaller/lesser water divide).

Letter 306:

&gt; *We must then have gone eastward over the two Scheidegge to Grindelwald, with Eiger and Mönch on our right, and eventually reached Meiringen. I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret: eternal snow, etched as it seemed against eternal sunshine, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue: the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams.*

Route

* Easy: Train from Lauterbrunnen to Kleine Scheidegg, and then down to Grindelwald. The Lauterbrunnen-Kleine Scheidegg-Grindelwald pass line opened in 1893 and was electrified before Tolkien arrived so it is an authentic option.

* Hard: Hike (19km, +/- 1400/1150m), [it is stage 11 of the Via-Alpina route](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/etappe-01560.html). However the Lauterbrunnen-Kleine Scheidegg-Grindelwald mountain trains present an escape option if you get too tired at any point, or want to cut the length down.

More info:

* The view of the Silberhorn which you get from Kleine Scheidegg [(a secondary peak of the Jungfrau)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silberhorn)) really stuck with Tolkien. He called it ""the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams"" (the peak with the tower where the Gandalf-Balrog fight ends, I had to look it up too).

* Go via Wengen for [the classic view up the valley](https://imgur.com/ykLg8sT
).

* An obvious diversion here would be taking the train to [Jungfraujoch]( https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfraujoch-top-of-europe/). This opened in 1912 after Tolkien passed by, but they had partial service to the Eiger and Eismeer windows before then, so he could have gone part way up though it seems likely he would have said so given how unique an experience it would have been.


---


**Stage 4: Grindelwald to Meiringen.**

Up and down over the Grosse Scheidegg pass (car free, bar the odd bus).

Source (letter 306)

&gt; We must then have gone eastward over the two Scheidegge to Grindelwald, with Eiger and Mönch on our right, and eventually reached Meiringen.

Route:

* Easy: Bus 128 from Grindelwald to Schwarzwaldalp, then Bus 148 down to Meiringen.

Moderate. Hike down to Rosenlaui or better yet a bit further to

* Hard: hike (23km, +/- 1100/1500m), [it is marked as stage 10 of the Via-Alpina route](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/etappe-01559.html), it could also make a very good 2 day hike with an overnight at the Rosenlaui.

More info:

* This passes by the [Hotel Rosenlaui](https://rosenlaui.ch/en/Welcome) , a belle-epoque style hotel which dates back to 1905 or older and has been kept as authentically as possible. [I stayed there in 2020 and wrote about the hotel and area around the Grosse Scheidegg in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/hmeujk/a_week_hiking_around_fiesch_and_rosenlaui/).

* The Grosse Scheidegg is much quieter, less developed, and at times more wild feeling than the Kleine Scheidegg which is much more touristy and is covered with ski infrastructure. 

* In the final approach to Meiningen you pass by the [Reichenbachfalls]( https://www.grimselwelt.ch/en/transport-lift/reichenbachfall) of Sherlock Holmes fame (not bad falls, but far from the best around). The funicular there opened in 1899 and it is very likely that at least someone in the party would have wanted to see it. 

* On which note the whole Sherlock Holmes theme to Meiringen is really surreal. Otherwise Meiringen is pleasant enough but nothing exciting (though it does claim to be home to the Meringue). 

---

**Stage 5: Meiringen to Brig.**

Up the Grimselpass, then down via Obergoms.

Letter 306:

&gt; *We later crossed the Grimsell Pass down on to the dusty highway, beside the Rhone, on which horse 'diligences' still plied: but not for us. We reached Brig on foot, a mere memory of noise : then a network of trams that screeched on their rails for it seemed at least 20 hrs of the day.*

Source

* *“On 17 August 1911, Tolkien's friend Christopher Wiseman replied to two cards received that day from Tolkien, who he said was 'on the other side of the valley' from Gletsch.”* ‘Tolkien's Worlds: The Places That Inspired the Writer's Imagination’ By John Garth.

Route:

* Easy: Bus 161 from Meiringen to Oberwald, then train down to Brig. Or a faster but less authentic (still scenic) option is taking the train to Brig via Interlaken and Spiez.

* Hard: Hike. This is about 73km with 2000m of height gain and loss. That combined with the first half being right next to a popular pass-road makes me suggest that walking the whole thing wouldn’t be the best idea.

More info:

* The section from Innertkirchen to Oberwald is one of the few places I have yet to visit.

* The [Aare gorge]( https://www.aareschlucht.ch/) just outside Meiringen opened to tourists in 1888 (and was actually more extensive then) and Tolkien would have had to have walked through or near it. Everyone seems keen to compare it to the rapids in Fellowship but he had also just actually taken a boat through the Rhine gorge in Germany which might also have played a big part there.

* Quite a bit would have changed along this section: big dams have been built by the pass with pylons taking the energy they generate down the valley, road has also opened up to much more tourist traffic and is a very popular tour for motorbikes.

* During warmer months a Postbus (#161) runs from Meiringen to Oberwald. From there you can take the train down to Brig. However the bus only runs twice a day or so, so you can’t hop on and off wherever it takes your fancy sadly. 

* If you do want to walk some of it I would suggest doing that in the Obergoms area which is a beautiful valley with meadows and small (mostly wooden and rustic) villages. For example [from Gluringen to Fiesch (via the suspension bridge)]( https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=12.05&amp;E=2657243&amp;N=1142185&amp;trackId=5169084).

* Brig is in my experience fairly forgettable. The old town is small but pleasant, and the Stockalper Schloss is pretty enough. Tolkien talks of “screeching trams”, I presume he meant the trains which were running down the valley then as Brig doesn’t seem to have ever had a tram network.

---

**Stage 6: Around the Aletsch glacier.**

Up the mountainside to the foot of the mighty glacier (all car free up there) where you can quite easily get at least a bit of the way into the UNESCO region. This actually gets most of Tolkien’s attention but is often overlooked in favour of the more popular Jungfrau region and Zermatt.

letter 306:

&gt;  *We climbed up some thousands of feet to a village at the foot of the Aletsch glacier, and there spent some nights in a châlet inn under a roof and in beds*

Letter 232:

&gt; *It was approaching the Aletsch that we were nearly destroyed by boulders loosened in the sun rolling down a snow-slope. An enormous rock in fact passed between me and the next in front. That and the 'thunder-battle' – a bad night in which we lost our way and slept in a cattle-shed – appear in The Hobbit.*

Route

* Easy: Take a cable car up to one of the villages like Riederalp/Bettmeralp/Fiescheralp and then a second cable car to the ridge with views down onto the Aletsch glacier. A very easy day-trip.

* Moderate: Cable car up and then some or all of the [Aletsch Panoramaweg](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/route-039.html).

* Hard: Hike all the way up from Brig and make a glacier tour.

More info:

* It seems that the village they stayed at was Belalp. The [Hotel Belalp](https://www.hotel-belalp.ch/hotel-belalp#10) has been there since 1856 so it is possible the group passed by or even stayed there.

* Otherwise maybe for the actual foot of the glacier “Oberer Aletsch” or “üssers Aletschi” would fit, but they are literally a few remote Alp sheds so are not the best option (or if you are hardcore they might actually be the best option). Eggen would also have been close to the glacier and remains quite small. After that Bealp or Riederalp are much more practical with shops and cable car access. Access around there via train and cable car is easy from Brig or anywhere else on the valley floor.


* [I have written more about the Aletsch region in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/hmeujk/a_week_hiking_around_fiesch_and_rosenlaui/).

* The Aletsch Glacier is one of the biggest highlights of Switzerland. It is hard to stress just how big it is ([the little blips at the front bottom are people]( https://i.imgur.com/e1QW3Ss.jpg)) The best viewing point is from the Eggishorn. [You can take the cable car up then hike alongside the glacier to Bettmeralp]( https://imgur.com/a/3AqlB). 

* The Aletsch Wald (a forest growing amongst glacially carved rocks) is beautiful and in part eerie. The hike [from Riederalp to Belalp or VV via the suspension bridge is fantastic](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/route-0150.html) (11km +/- 700/880). Or just drop down from Riederalp where it starts quite close to the village. The first time I went to do this hike a thunderstorm swept in and I found myself very quickly returning back to Riederalp. This route would have been partially under the glacier in 1911.

* A guide or skills and equipment are needed if you want to go on the glacier itself.

**Stage 7: High Valais.**

Things get a bit confused here with CBS and Tolkien seeming to disagree on the route.

CBS:

&gt; Based on a route marked on a map by an older member of the group CBS gives the route as: Visp - Stalden - St Niklaus - Gruben - Forcletta pass - Grimenz - Hauderes - Arolla. He isn’t reported as mentioning Zermatt but seems less sure after what they did in Arolla saying that “we must have walked down the Val d’Herens to Sion”.

Letter 306:

&gt; *After this we went on into Valais, and my memories are less clear; though I remember our arrival, bedraggled, one evening in Zermatt and the lorgnette stares of the French bourgeoises dames. We climbed with guides up to [a] high hut of the Alpine Club, roped (or I should have fallen into a snow-crevasse), and I remember the dazzling whiteness of the tumbled snow-desert between us and the black horn of the Matterhom some miles away.*

Source:

&gt; *25 August 1911 Tolkien signs the guest book at the Cabane de Bertol, above Arolla on the Col de Bertol (Bertol Pass). This is presumably the day trip to a high-altitude hut recalled by both Tolkien and Colin Brookes-Smith.*

It is possible that (1) they followed the route given by CBS and then over the glaciers to Zermatt (you would certainly be bedraggled after that), or (2) went up to Zermatt first then back down to St Niklaus and through the passes and up to Arolla, or (3) it could be that one or both of the accounts is wrong/incomplete.

Route:

* Easy: Train to Zermatt and then go up to Gornergrat. You can also reach Arolla by bus from Sion.

* Moderate: Some of the passes, or there are plenty of hikes around Zermatt and Arolla.

* Hard: There is plenty of room for the hard option here. The route described by CBS from Stalden up to Arolla then the Cabane de Bertol crosses 3 passes and is a rather hardcore 92km with +7500m / -5000m. From Zermatt to the Cabane de Bertol and then down to Arolla. There is no path and this involves crossing a glacier. The last part is for experts or those with a qualified guide only.

More info:

* Tolkien signed the guest book at the [Cabane de Bertol](https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts-and-tours/sac-route-portal/cabane-de-bertol-cas-2147000031/mountain-hiking/). Which on a rocky outcrop at 3311m is one the higher and more exposed huts in Switzerland. There is no easy way to get there, the approach from nearby Arolla is quite tough being 1300m of height over 8km, including a glacier/ice crossing even in summer.

* There are various options for a similar experience. I am going to pick Gornergrat for this. You can hike up there, or take the train up from Zermatt (the fully electric train opened in 1898). The height at 3089m is similar and you are surrounded by high peaks and glaciers.

* The CBS valley hopping route is the biggest section of the trip that can’t be directly covered with public transport.

* Given how much parts of the trip seem to translate directly to the Hobbit you might see it that the Matterhorn is the Lonely Mountain reached at the end of a long and perilous journey. Though he never said that himself and clearly it is lacking a lake, and isn’t THAT lonely, so (like with most things Tolkien) the inspiration wouldn’t be 100% direct.

* Once in Zermatt itself you have plenty of hiking and other activities to do. [I have written about it before too]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8t38ph/report_my_first_time_in_zermatt_switzerland/).

* I have been meaning to visit Arolla and do some of the passes described by CBS for a while, but it was only recently that I learned this part of  the itinerary, so sadly I can’t provide any advice there.

* Mark Twain also came to Zermatt, his ascent of the Riffelberg and to Gornergrat in ‘A Tramp Abroad’ is well worth a read.

**Stage 8: Homeward**

CBS: 

&gt; “we must have walked down the Val d’Herens to Sion”.

Whether they ended up in Arolla or Zermat they would have gone down to the main Rhone valley in Valais. 

Other than a long walk down you can take the bus from Arolla down to Sion, or the train from Zermatt to Visp. Both ways put you on the main train line with connections on to Geneva and Zürich.

---

**---How I would do this---**

If I ever find myself out of work during the summer I will take a few months to recreate the whole thing and write a book about it.

If that was too much info and you just want a fixed plan then this is what I would suggest for 10-14 days (for shorter time frames you could use public transport to skip whole sections). This is full on, so add a rest day in as you like. 

* Day 1: Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen by train. Walk along the valley to the Trummelbachfalls, double back to Lauterrunnen, take the cable car to Grütschalp and then the Mountain Trail hike to Mürren.

* Day 2: End of valley hike.

* Day 3: Hike over the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald. (Shortcut up or down with train)

* Day 4: Hike over the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. (shortcut with bus)

* Day 5: Meiringen to Brig via bus and train. Hike along a section of the Obergoms (eg: Gluringen to Fiesch).

* Day 6: Cable car up to Eggishorn, admire the glacier and follow the path along to Bettmeralp.

* Day 7: Hike from Rideralp to Belalp via the Aletsch forest.

* Day 8: Train to Zermatt. Take a gentle hike up to Zmutt.

* Day 9: Zermatt. [Take the train to Gornergrat and adventure along the ridge]( https://imgur.com/a/hpBbT).

* Day 10: Zermatt. [Hike the Edelweissweg](https://imgur.com/a/7aDNa).

You could then spend a day or two travelling to Chur and visit the Greisinger museum. Though I would try and avoid the Glacier Express and take local trains myself. Stop off at places like the Rhine gorge to make the most of it.


---

**---Misc---**

* It is a bit out the way of this route, and nowhere near where Tolkien himself went, but the [Greisinger Museum]( http://www.greisinger.museum/en/) sounds like it is worth checking out. Basically a dedicated/mad Swiss bloke made a museum containing Hobbit-hole near Chur. You can book tours by language on their website. At 50CHF it isn’t cheap (but is still cheaper than Hobbiton in NZ).

* [Villa Vals is often posted as the Swiss Hobbit House]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/frd4gy/villa_vals_the_often_posted_hobbit_house_of/), though it is far too exposed and concrete to really look like that.

* It is said in his biography that at some point in the trip Tolkien bought of postcard of [“Der Berggeist” by Josef Madlener]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Der_Berggeist.jpg) which he kept and later wrote on it “origin of Gandalf”. However the daughter of the artist says the painting was most likely done in the period 1925-1930, so he probably didn’t pick it up in Switzerland.

* Tolkien never went anywhere near it, but Appenzell is basically the shire as much as it can be found in Switzerland today  (in as much as a part of Swizterland can be like the English Midlands.). A very traditional rural area (women in Appenzell Innerrhoden couldn’t vote on local issues until 1991) that is worth a few days to explore.

1542,lu8z94,How do I convince Brother's girlfriend to keep watching the Jackson Trilogy?,"I have a situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently living at my brother's house and he and I are both huge lotr fans. He's been dating this girl for some time now and she is awesome. She's 100% supportive and a perfect fit for my brother (so no jokes about her and my brother breaking up, ok?)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, we all sat down, we all got drunk, and watched Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring together. This is late at night, and she prefers to go to bed early. She dosed off a couple of times throughout the film (let me put it this way, when Boromir died, she thought everyone, except Frodo, died. In hindsight, it might have been a joke.) 

&amp;#x200B;

After the film, she was not fully sure if she wanted to move forward on the trilogy, to say the least. I tried being empathetic. I stated that the film has a lot of backstory behind it and a lot of the exposition can go way over the head of a new viewer. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give her credit where credit is due, she really tried to learn all of the names of the members of the fellowship and paid attention to their characters. My brother and I tried to explain things as best as possible to her, and we both made sure she was watching scenes that are especially important. By the end, she may have gotten the overall gist of the movie, but she still missed out on key moments and had exposition go over her head.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we can all agree that these are fantastic films that are worth watching. I think most of us can also admit that they can be slow paced at times (with important dialogue and exposition, of course, but slow paced, none the less.) It is hard to convince someone that is not used to this genre to give it a shot and let them appreciate it for all the beauty that it has.     

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my main question is... How do I convince her to keep watching? How do I approach this issue?

However, he seems to have used a lot of his power to subdue the Balrog in Moria by using a spell to hold that door closed, and later to battle the Balrog. Does this not count as interfering by using power to match power, since if it weren't for him, the Balrog would have wiped out the fellowship? Or did Gandalf not use the full extent of his power when fighting the Balrog?

Or, was he allowed to use all of his power to fight and kill the Balrog because otherwise he would have died for good and therefore would not have been able to rally the free peoples of Middle earth to fight the war of the ring?

I was thinking of buying 5 or 6 notebooks - one for each race (Valar, maiar, elves, men, dwarves) and maybe one for a timeline.

Each race notebook could have a list of names/characters per page and their parents, siblings, relations etc and then big events of their life etc The Valar could be the same but with a list of which Maia ‘belong’ to that Valar.

Timeline would obviously be like 1/10/100 years per page and then a list of stuff.

What do you guys think? What would you assign each notebook to? What else would you add and consider noting during a Silmarillion read through?

Would be really interested to see if any of you have done this and how you got on/what you’d recommend to do!

1665,lr4yq4,"Isn’t the cohesion and detail of Tolkien’s created world (+lore) contradictory to his displeasure of the of the modern world, and ultimately to his goal of creating myth?","[Discussion] Tolkein created Arda and LOTR etc as a kind of English myth, and the themes of his world have to do with machinery; Middle-Earth is expressly anti-machinery, decentralised and less developed than our contemporary Earth. If his goal was to add to English legend, I’d argue that a failure in achieving this was ironically in his punctuality and explanatory way he constructed Arda. I think a reason why LOTR is seen more as a piece of contemporary media rather than English myth is because he created a whole interconnected world which is very obviously separate from ours - it’s not “in a land far far away” (or possibly fitting sometime in our history), it’s very obviously it’s own world. Also, if modern technology removes the mystery of the world and reflects our desire to conquer and “coerce” the world, it strikes me as odd that he would remove the mystery of his own world by being so upfront and clear about the divinity, history and geography of his world.

[Discussion] Tolkein created Arda and LOTR etc as a kind of English myth, and the themes of his world have to do with machinery; Middle-Earth is expressly anti-machinery, decentralised and less developed than our contemporary Earth. If his goal was to add to English legend, I’d argue that a failure in achieving this was ironically in his punctuality and explanatory way he constructed Arda. I think a reason why LOTR is seen more as a piece of contemporary media rather than English myth is because he created a whole interconnected world which is very obviously separate from ours - it’s not “in a land far far away” (or possibly fitting sometime in our history), it’s very obviously it’s own world. Also, if modern technology removes the mystery of the world and reflects our desire to conquer and “coerce” the world, it strikes me as odd that he would remove the mystery of his own world by being so upfront and clear about the divinity, history and geography of his world.

TD;LR at the bottom. If this helps anybody, I’ll be glad. I’ll be using this for myself years to come to save time. 

Disc 1: 5/10. Some excellent general overviews and technical exploration of production, art, costumes, props, but not especially engaging. Hence average review, straight down the middle.  Overall, many of the concepts will be reviewed again in more detail. 

Disc 2: 8/10 the first half is iconic cast interviews. The ends is more modeling background, and then introducing the cgi methods they invented. Old news now but groundbreaking at the time. At the end some interesting but kinda dull color grading tech. Some COOL stuff about audio recording at the end, and ADR interviews, and music score. Info on the premiere.

Disc 3: 7/10, so excellent. Better paced and more engaging, though very long. Covers thematic, Tolkien and adaption, design (better than disc 1), Gollum, and some great interviews. Worth watching. 

Disc 4: 7/10 Beginning is iconic stunt and combat interviews. Honestly; the whole thing is iconic. Slower than disc 2, but continuous quality. A bit more of the cast adult humor making fun of each other. Becomes very long and slow in the second half talking about music and technical elements. Wonderful, but you need a break. Or can stop after they talk about animating Legolas jumping on a horse to keep the tempo high. Fun moments throughout, nice end 

Disc 5: 6/10. The second half is 8/10, the first half is a bit bland. First 10 min are nice, but then loses some steam. Still better than disc 1. 

Disc 6: 8/10. Legendary interviews and some wonderful stuff on the third movie, especially the nostalgic grief and joy of ending production. Slows a bit in the third quarter but that’s normal for these. Really wonderful throughout. Problems: some periods focused on spiders, which I hate visually. But it’s not gratuitous.

1678,lq0vtc,I just finished the Lord of the Rings for the first time and I need to talk about it.,"Short background: I didn't really have any intention to read these books. I loved the movies, and enjoy fantasy, but didn't think they would be my cup of tea. Fortunately, as an audible member I had access to the audiobook of *The Hobbit* for free, and decided to give it a listen. I really enjoyed it, so I took the plunge and bought all three audiobooks and just recently finished them. I also read *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* for good measure :)

Anyway, these books were amazing. I know they're classics, but I was expecting to be bored. The reason is that so much modern fantasy (whether books, games, or movies) take inspiration from LotR, that I thought it would be redundant. I wasn't interested in dwarves, elves, orcs, or even hobbits! I thought I knew enough through cultural osmosis, but boy was I wrong!

There's so much interesting lore here! Even though I had seen the movies, I never realized that destroying the ring would make magic disappear from Middle-Earth and the elves would have to leave. That made the triumph bittersweet. Another tragic part was the Ents not being able to reproduce because the Entwives were gone. There's the whole Tom Bombadil section which I loved. He, Goldberry, and Old Man Willow are all enigmas. The history of the rings, the balrog in Moria, Lothlorien, I could go on.

My favorite part was how much of an adventure it was. There was this feeling of going on a quest, exploring new lands, running into places and people you don't understand, I was constantly surprised! The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring did this best. Being caught by the barrow-wight, running into Tom Bombadil, resting in Lothlorien, getting lost in Fangor and finding the Ents, sneaking through Mordor, there's so many wonderful scenes that are each their own little story.

I have to say that there are certain aspects I didn't enjoy as much. The descriptions of battle scenes weren't very... thrilling. It doesn't go into enough detail, so it felt kind of detached from the characters. I would much rather just watch the battles from the movies. Likewise, while I enjoyed the descriptions of the landscapes, it was often hard to picture in my head - again this is something movies do much better.

I also thought some of the characters were underdeveloped. Legolas and Gimli were kind of plain, as were Pippin and Merry. A lot of the characters feel too similar, and many feel too goody-goody, if you know what I mean. My favorites were Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn, with an honorable mention to Gollum.

1695,lq5glg,A question about Sauron and the battle of Dagorlad.,"So quick question,  I know in the movies they show Isildur watch as his father is killed by Sauron, he reaches for his old man's sword and Sauron curb-stomps it, breaking it in the process. Isildur then uses the shard of the sword to choppety-chop off Saurons finger(s) (it looks like more than one in the movie), and with the ring separated from him, he implodes like a baby nuke. Isildur takes the jewelry for hisself, and the rest is history, of Middle earth.... in the movie, most importantly here. 

Now, according to the books, and reading what Elrond had to say about the matter, (who was there to witness the battle) he says, (page 243, chapter ""The Council of Elrond"")

""I was the herald of Gil-Galad and marched with his host. I was at the battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-Galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aeglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-Galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword and took it for his own."" 

Now as much as my own writing is totally in every way sexier and better than Tolkiens, lol, I kid, I kid,.... I'm confused here... it almost seems to suggest that Sauron was defeated in battle and then as he lay in defeat, Isildur cut off his finger and stole the ring, sealing his fate...  but how did it really go down? Is the movie true to the Canon? He chopped his finger off as he reached for him, almost in a total lucky fluke of a move? Or did Isildur and whoever else beat down Sauron enough that he was defeated or weakend a bunch before the coup de grace could be dealt to his uhh, finger? 

Just curious, but the way Elrond speaks about it, it would suggest to me that he was beaten in battle before his finger got a 9-karat haircut or bested in some fashion. Idk, I guess it doesn't specifically say that, it just seems that way from the order he phrased it in: ""we had the mastery"" and Sauron himself was overthrown AND Isildur cut the ring from his hand."" Almost as if its two separate things, not saying he was simply defeated because of this.

So quick question,  I know in the movies they show Isildur watch as his father is killed by Sauron, he reaches for his old man's sword and Sauron curb-stomps it, breaking it in the process. Isildur then uses the shard of the sword to choppety-chop off Saurons finger(s) (it looks like more than one in the movie), and with the ring separated from him, he implodes like a baby nuke. Isildur takes the jewelry for hisself, and the rest is history, of Middle earth.... in the movie, most importantly here. 

Now, according to the books, and reading what Elrond had to say about the matter, (who was there to witness the battle) he says, (page 243, chapter ""The Council of Elrond"")

""I was the herald of Gil-Galad and marched with his host. I was at the battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-Galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aeglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-Galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword and took it for his own."" 

Now as much as my own writing is totally in every way sexier and better than Tolkiens, lol, I kid, I kid,.... I'm confused here... it almost seems to suggest that Sauron was defeated in battle and then as he lay in defeat, Isildur cut off his finger and stole the ring, sealing his fate...  but how did it really go down? Is the movie true to the Canon? He chopped his finger off as he reached for him, almost in a total lucky fluke of a move? Or did Isildur and whoever else beat down Sauron enough that he was defeated or weakend a bunch before the coup de grace could be dealt to his uhh, finger? 

Just curious, but the way Elrond speaks about it, it would suggest to me that he was beaten in battle before his finger got a 9-karat haircut or bested in some fashion. Idk, I guess it doesn't specifically say that, it just seems that way from the order he phrased it in: ""we had the mastery"" and Sauron himself was overthrown AND Isildur cut the ring from his hand."" Almost as if its two separate things, not saying he was simply defeated because of this. 

Id just like to know, and if he was defeated in combat who dunnit?

1709,lpsvoi,"As fans, we are spoiled by the numerous LOTR/Tolkien adaptations. What are your favorites?","One of the great things about being a LOTR/Tolkien fan is that the enduring popularity of the Tolkien's works has led to numerous adaptations of the books. I try to read, listen, or watch the LOTR once a year. I've realized that when I picture different characters, locations, or scenes from the books, I end up pulling from different sources to create the image in my mind. I love being able to pick out the best parts from different adaptations, combining them with others or my own imagination, to create my 'ideal' scene.

This year, I've decided to jot down my thoughts as I went through them. If some of these versions are new to you, I hope you will check them out! And please share your thoughts on my list below, and definitely add to it for any versions I've missed. I have not included the Peter Jackson films because I think nearly everyone will have already seen those. I will say that, while I find the Jackson films to be great, in some ways I find them inferior to some of the adaptations listed below. For example, when I picture Aragorn, I don't immediately think of Viggo Mortensen, but of the portrayals from the LOTR BBC Dramatization, and the Ralph Bakshi animated film...notably, just the actor's voice, not how the film depicted the character visually..)

**Audio** **Dramatizations**

1. **The Hobbit: BBC Radio Dramatization, 1968.** (**2.5/5 stars)** One of my least favorite adaptations, this version is just under 4 hours long. Some fans will appreciate experiencing this interpretation just to see how people imagined the characters, or the effort that went into the production. More often than not, I think the BBC missed the mark with the actors and how they brought the characters to life. The best portrayals are Bilbo and Gollum. Overall, there are more enjoyable versions of The Hobbit to experience, but I still make it a point to listen to this one (perhaps it's just my completionist attitude?). I came across this version as an adult, but I wonder how this would be viewed by children or younger fans? The Hobbit was written with a younger audience in mind, and I think it can be said that this version makes no attempt to interpret the book any other way. Perhaps that is another reason to give this version a chance, to contrast with later versions (such as Peter Jackson's films) that tried to inject more of The Lord of the Rings into Bilbo's first outing. *Note: I googled this to confirm the correct year and version and came across this* [*Archive.org link*](https://archive.org/details/the-hobbit-bbc-radio-drama/J.R.R.+Tolkien+-+The+Hobbit+-+Disc+1+-+01+-+An+Unexpected+Party-+Mr.+Bilbo+Baggins.flac) *that should allow you to listen to this version for free if you wish.* 
2. **The Hobbit: American Dramatization, NPR Broadcast, 1960s. (1/5 stars)** This is my least favorite version. I cannot think of anything that stands out in this adaptation that would lead me to recommend you to give this one a listen. I will say that, similar to the BBC's 1968 dramatization, they did at least do pretty well with Gollum's voice actor; unfortunately, the rest of the cast are all over the place (and wherever that may be, it isn't Middle-Earth); it seems like Thorin's portrayal is inspired by Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh?! An easy skip. Perhaps if I'd grown up with this adaptation, it might have a soft spot in my heart. *I could not find a free version of this, but this is an* [*Amazon link*](https://www.amazon.com/The-Hobbit-J-R-R-Tolkien-audiobook/dp/B000R3OP2Y) *that provides a short Audible sample*
3. ***The Lord of the Rings: BBC Radio Dramatization, 1981. (5/5).*** A grand way to experience The Lord of the Rings over approximately 13 hours. This version has a special place in my heart: as a kid, I checked this version out from the library countless times. Back then, it was a cassette tape version which meant a huge plastic 'binder' with 13 tapes. This version famously features Ian Holm as Frodo (with Ian Holm of course later appearing as Bilbo in Peter Jackson's films). I am admittedly biased and nostalgic toward this version, but I think this version is a classic that every fan should experience at least once. Despite its age, it holds up extremely well, with a great cast. This production truly brings the book to life, in some cases offering more depth than Jackson's film adaptation. With 13 hours to flesh out the book, the dramatization is able to take its time as we journey out from The Shire. One of the great things about this being a radio dramatization is that, since there is no visual spectacle, we avoid the tendency of Jackson's films to have battle scenes dominate the running time. More of the story is advanced from the perspective of background characters that were glossed over or not included at all in the films (for example, The Gaffer, Ted Sandyman, or Farmer Maggot). If I had to pick just one specific version of the Lord of the Rings, I honestly might pick this over all the others. I encourage every fan to check this version out, at least once; you might find yourself drawn more to the character interpretations portrayed here than those that appeared in the films or other adaptations.

**Audiobooks**

1. **The Hobbit: RecordedBooks, Unabridged Narration by Rob Inglis, 2001. (5/5).** If you prefer the traditional, unabridged experience that audiobooks provide, this is a great listen. I personally have a hard time getting into most audiobooks; sometimes the narrator just doesn't vibe with me. Fortunately, that isn't the case here. Rob Inglis brings each character to life, although in the more subdued manner you would expect from an audiobook, compared to the radio/stage adaptations listed above. Although I haven't personally seen it, I did find out that Rob Inglis had originally performed a one-may play for The Hobbit, which led to him being asked to do this narration.

2. **The Lord of the Rings: RecordedBooks, Unabridged Narration by Rob Inglis (5/5).** Fortunately Rob Inglis was brought back to continue his narration of Tolkien's works. At one point, this was marketed as 'the only unabridged recording' for the Lord of the Rings, although I suspect this is no longer true. Like the previous entry, Rob Inglis effortlessly switches between characters; a superb narration. Perhaps there is more to be said, but at the end of the day, if you want a complete, unabridged LOTR experience, this one is it.

**Film Adaptations:**

1. **The Hobbit: Rankin Bass, 1977 Animated Film. (4.5/5)** I think most fans will be aware of this version. There seems to be a bit of a divide on this one: if you grew up with the film as a child, you probably love the film, out of nostalgia if for no other reason. For those without the connection, you might be less inclined to give the film a chance, or to overlook the film's weaknesses. I grew up watching this on VHS so many times that I could probably have recited the script from memory at one point. Unfortunately it seems that the versions of this film currently on sale don't include all of the original songs, which is a tragedy as I think these songs are the best out of all the Tolkien adaptations. The animation, artwork, and voice actors are fantastic; yes, you may think some parts don't hold up as well today, but overall there's still a lot to love, especially for children. It's a nearly 50-year old film that laid the groundwork for what came later. Deep down this is a 5/5 film, but in an attempt to look at it more objectively, I have compromised to a 4.5 :)
2. **The Lord of the Rings, Ralph Bakshi, 1977 (5/5).** I'm sure many will disagree with my 5/5 rating. Perhaps a 4 or 4.5 might be warranted as the film is not absolutely perfect. As someone who grew up watching this film on VHS, I undoubtedly overlook some of the film's shortcomings. At the same time, I think the film warrants some considerations. The Lord of the Rings had struggled for decades finding a company willing to invest in adapting the books to film. Bakshi spent years trying to convince people, and ultimately failed to get United Artists on board with basic things like clearly marketing the film as ""part one"" - UA felt people wouldn't pay to see just 'half of a film'. The film's production was troubled, and of course the film famously left on an unresolved cliff-hanger as Bakshi wasn't given the chance to make the sequel. Imagine how Jackson's trilogy might have suffered if he'd been forced to condense the books into just 1 or 2 films? Still, while characters like Aragon and Boromir are visually depicted in a fairly ridiculous manner, Bakshi got a lot of things right - and it's evident where this film later inspired Jackson's own interpretation. The films are worth a watch even just to appreciate the unique talent and techniques that went into the film (most famously, the rotoscoping). 
3. **The Return of the King, Rankin Bass, 1980 Animated Film (3/5).** Rankin Bass came back to finish the trilogy. Unfortunately, their interpretation was a better fit for The Hobbit than it  was for Return of the King. This version offers some great songs (*where there's a whip, there's a way!)* and I think is still an enjoyable watch, but the film struggles to offer a more compelling take on the book compared to other adaptations. Orson Bean (Frodo &amp; Bilbo) and John Huston (Gandalf) are fantastic. I did find an interesting tidbit while looking up some of the background details on this film. I think this gives important context for these films, especially to those looking back with the hindsight of how successful Peter Jackson's films ended up being. From the Wiki entry: *Director* [*Arthur Rankin Jr.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rankin_Jr.) *later stated, ""We tried to do Return of the King... but it is an awful lot to put into it. I think* [*\[Peter\] Jackson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson) *is having the same problem in* [*his films*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy)*. You can't deviate from these books, or somebody'll wait on the street for you! ...\[In\] The Return of the King, we had to summarize what had happened before, and then put it all together in 2 hours. It's not a very good film."" Asked why he chose only to make The Return of the King, instead of making the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, Rankin admitted, ""I didn't know that the audience would sit still for it. I was wrong.""*

So, that's my list. Let me know your thoughts, and chime in with those adaptations I haven't listed - which ones are worth a listen or a watch?",2021-02-22 16:35:25,0,,2,0.67,0,0,2,0,7,0,0,0,Mon,0,0,"As fans, we are spoiled by the numerous LOTR/Tolkien adaptations.

The film's production was troubled, and of course the film famously left on an unresolved cliff-hanger as Bakshi wasn't given the chance to make the sequel. Imagine how Jackson's trilogy might have suffered if he'd been forced to condense the books into just 1 or 2 films? Still, while characters like Aragon and Boromir are visually depicted in a fairly ridiculous manner, Bakshi got a lot of things right - and it's evident where this film later inspired Jackson's own interpretation. The films are worth a watch even just to appreciate the unique talent and techniques that went into the film (most famously, the rotoscoping). 
3. **The Return of the King, Rankin Bass, 1980 Animated Film (3/5).** Rankin Bass came back to finish the trilogy. Unfortunately, their interpretation was a better fit for The Hobbit than it  was for Return of the King. This version offers some great songs (*where there's a whip, there's a way!)* and I think is still an enjoyable watch, but the film struggles to offer a more compelling take on the book compared to other adaptations. Orson Bean (Frodo &amp; Bilbo) and John Huston (Gandalf) are fantastic. I did find an interesting tidbit while looking up some of the background details on this film. I think this gives important context for these films, especially to those looking back with the hindsight of how successful Peter Jackson's films ended up being. From the Wiki entry: *Director* [*Arthur Rankin Jr.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rankin_Jr.) *later stated, ""We tried to do Return of the King... but it is an awful lot to put into it. I think* [*\[Peter\] Jackson*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson) *is having the same problem in* [*his films*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy)*. You can't deviate from these books, or somebody'll wait on the street for you! ...\[In\] The Return of the King, we had to summarize what had happened before, and then put it all together in 2 hours. It's not a very good film."" Asked why he chose only to make The Return of the King, instead of making the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, Rankin admitted, ""I didn't know that the audience would sit still for it. I was wrong.""*

So, that's my list. Let me know your thoughts, and chime in with those adaptations I haven't listed - which ones are worth a listen or a watch?"

1718,lptjdn,Recommendations for oil painting subject,"Hello - I have commissioned an artist to create an oil painting of a Lord of the Rings character with my face swapped in. His work is amazing and I'm really looking forward to the finished product, but I don't know which character or scene to use, so I'm looking for recommendations. I'm thinking Aragorn makes the most sense given that he's human, we're both men, and I kind of look like him if you don't focus intently. An intense moment with a close-up of a face - maybe in a battle or something similar - would be ideal, but I'm also interested in moments of critical importance for the overall storyline.

Here are a few of my thoughts:

1. When Aragorn fights with the undead in the cave, I am completely overwhelmed with the epicness of the story. I love that scene and it's probably really good for a painting.
2. The Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul in Moria against the cave trolls and orcs is an iconic scene for obvious reasons.
3. The Battle of Helm's Deep is also an iconic scene. Aragorn standing on the wall overlooking the impending onslaught is one of the most tense moments in the whole series for me.

I'm open to ideas and recommendations in every regard and any contributions would be greatly appreciated.",2021-02-22 17:00:53,0,,1,0.66,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,Mon,0,0,"Recommendations for oil painting subject Hello - I have commissioned an artist to create an oil painting of a Lord of the Rings character with my face swapped in.
