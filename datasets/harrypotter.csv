,harrypotter,"I binged all eight movies last month during a school holiday. I’d watched some of them sporadically in my childhood, but never really got into Harry Potter (books or movies) much. 

Fast forward to now and, in short, I’m obsessed. I got super sad once I finished the movies for the first time so I watched them all again, but that didn’t fill the void. I just bought the U.K. book set today and it’s arriving tomorrow, and I seriously can’t wait. I’ve heard countless times that the books are better in every aspect, so I hope I can relearn the world again. 

Before I got into my new books though, I wanted to know what house I was in. I guess everyone wants to figure that out at some point, right? I took the Pottermore sorting quiz and got Hufflepuff. Beyond upset, I closed the tab. I wanted Gryffindor, probably just like every person who goes through the movies (or books) for the first time and is fastened to Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s characters. Then, I found [this](https://www.gotoquiz.com/pottermore_sorting_quiz_all_possible_question) quiz, which I quickly realized was more or less the same as the first. Hufflepuff, again. Sad face, at least initially. While browsing Reddit trying to make sense of the results, I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pottermore/comments/44os14/pottermore_sorting_hat_quiz_analysis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post. After going through it, I realized Hufflepuff is exactly where I belong. 

I can’t really blame myself for wanting to be in Gryffindor, I guess I wanted to feel more of a connection to the trio. But I love Hufflepuff. Although I agree there isn’t necessarily a “best” house and we’re all good in our own way, Hufflepuff definitely stands next to principles, morals, and characteristics I find true in myself.

First off, starting with the prophecy it says ""neither can live while the other survives"" meaning between the two people one of them will die and one of them will live, obviously. Dumbledore says clearly to Harry he's doing everything he can to make sure Harry is the one who survives. 

The next part of the prophecy is that Harry will have a power of the dark Lord knows not. Dumbledore instantly recognizes this as the power of love. Even when Voldemort was a kid Dumbledore recognized that Voldemort didn't know what it meant to be a friend and he didn't know what it meant to care about others and therefore he didn't understand or value love. So after Harry survived when he was a baby, what does Dumbledore do? He sends Harry to his family. At this point I don't think he knew they would abuse Harry (cause let's be fair, all Dumbldore knew about Petunia was that she's muggle who envied her magical sister, wanting so badly to be a witch herself, perhaps she would then respect or value the magical world? Turns out she didn't, but to be fair again, all Dumbledore had to go on we're letters written 10+ years ago and he *did* plead to her to treat Harry as her own son). Dumbledore only really knew that the blood connecting Harry to his mother and to his aunt would act as protection because that blood represented the sacrifice that Lily made to keep Harry alive, and therefore the blood sacrifice that would protect Harry from Voldemort, again because Voldemort doesn't understand the concept of sacrificing yourself solely because you love someone. Turns out the Dursleys did abuse Harry, but despite this he gained a deep appreciation for family and frieds because he didn't have either as a child.

Because Harry understood the importance of having a family, I think it drew him closer to Ron and Hermione and then later to Sirius- which is important. Even after Sirius's death when Harry's throwing things around Dumbledore's office screaming about how much it hurts Dumbledore points out to him that this pain he's feeling is his greatest strength. Why? Because Harry wanted to die rather than allow Sirius to die, which means he understood the importance of self-sacrifice in the effort to save the ones you love, a feeling that Voldemort would never and could never understand because all Voldemort cared about was power and self-preservation. 

Later when Harry understands the fullness of the prophecy and he feels the immense burden and responsibility to go and find Voldemort to kill him, Dumbledore instantly tells him he needs to go tell Ron and Hermione, they need to be with him and that even though this is very important information that needs to remain secret, Dumbldore recognized that Harry needed support from those he loves because needed companions, something that Voldemort never had (again, going back to loving others). 

But then Dumbledore also tells Harry out right, he can walk away from this, he doesn't have to have the prophecy apply to him because at the end of the day they're just words. The only reason the prophecy is affecting people is because they're acting like it's fact. But when Dumbldore asks Harry to imagine his life if he went forward without knowing about the prophecy, what would Harry naturally want to do? Harry says outright, he'd want to kill Voldemort to prevent more people from dying because Voldemort took away those he loved. That stopping Voldemort is a cause worth dying for.  Harry recognizes right then and there that it's not like he's being forced to face Voldemort but he's *choosing* to face him. All the work that Dumbledore's doing is to best ensure that Harry survives by telling Harry about the horcruxes and telling Harry how to destroy the horcruxes so that when Harry faces Voldemort, Voldemort would be just a normal mortal man though still a powerful wizard. 

I also think Dumbledore recognized the connection Harry and Voldemort shared, that Harry had accidentally become a horcrux when he was a baby and survived the curse because Voldemort's sole was so severely shattered at the point. This told Dumbledore that Harry would have to die, however when he died it would be Voldemort's soul being killed not Harry's, because again Harry's was protected by the power of love, both the love that his family had for him and also the love that he has for those around him, whereas Voldemort's soul had no protection. (And if you want to argue that there's no way Dumbledore could know this, we need to remember that about 80% of the plan to kill Voldemort was speculation. Dumbledore says himself that he's mostly guessing but typically his guesses are correct).

So at the end of all, I don't think Dumbledore was preparing Harry for death, I think he knew it would be an incredibly difficult journey, but because of his theories about the power of love and about Harry being a horcrux I think  Dumbledore had a pretty good certainty that Harry would be able to survive it all because, again, he was able to feel that self sacrificial love for those around him, and be was protected by the same love from others (like, come on, at the battle of Hogwarts everyone was basically ""it's ok if I die Harry, just try to stop Voldemort"").

During the Yule Ball, ""Moody"" compliments Harry on his socks, which he'd received from Dobby. But Moody couldn't see those socks through conventional methods; he saw them using his magical false eye. Immediately after this, Parvati said she thought Moody and his eye were ""so creepy,"" which Harry pretty much dismissed because he liked Moody. When I first read this as a teenager, I didn't think much of it.

But now? Of COURSE any teenage girl would be weirded out by Moody's magical eye! It can clearly see through clothing, so girls like Parvati would know that Moody was completely capable of seeing their underwear...or perhaps underneath. We're never truly certain how Moody's eye works - does he have to put forth effort to see certain things (like socks under robes), or does he just see these things automatically? Regardless, this would be seriously creepy.

If he were my teacher, I would be wondering if he was keeping his eye to himself, so to speak. So many older men creep on teenage girls - almost every girl I know has dealt with a male teacher or coach that gave them the creeps (myself included). I would lump Moody into the same category. His actual intent would be irrelevant in my eyes; the mere fact that he was capable of essentially undressing me with his eye would be enough to make me very uncomfortable in his presence. I would think ""he looked at Harry's socks under his robes and then *commented on them* to Harry; what is he looking at on me?!""

Now, do I think that the *real* Alastor Moody would do anything sexually inappropriate? No, I do not.

We’re currently wrapping up Prisoner of Azkaban, and we’ve spent a decent amount of time lately discussing character development and analysis. 

They think Harry is brave and kind, and clearly see him as the hero. Hermione always makes them giggle with her adoration for homework and rules but we’ve also been discussing that she often acts as a moral compass for her friends, and leads people towards empathy. They think Ron is silly and we’ve discussed the importance of comic relief during tense moments. They’ve also pointed out that Harry is the bravest out of the three, although they all ended up in Gryffindor. We talk about all of the characters at length, but those three obviously take center stage.

the lyrics just work perfect for the dementors. i just thought i'd share this because it works so well.




lyrics:

The air begins to feel a little thin

As I start the car, and then I begin

To add the miles piled up behind me

I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south

I want to crack the door so I can just fall out

But then I remember when you packed my car

You reached in the back and buckled up your heart

For me to drive away with

I began to understand why God died

The demons sat there waiting on her porch

It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch

And when my car was far out of sight

He crept in her room and stayed there for the 
night

And then I felt chills in my bones

The breath I saw was not my own

I knew my skin that wrapped my frame

Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand

He laid it out, what he had planned

And then I said I'll take the grave

Please just send them all my way

And then I felt chills in my bones

The breath I saw was not my own

I knew my skin that wrapped my frame

Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand

He laid it out, what he had planned

And then I said I'll take the grave

Please just send them all my way

I began to understand why God died

The air begins to feel a little thin

As we're waiting for the morning to begin

But for now you told me to hold this jar

And when I looked inside I saw it held your heart

Guys, the story isn't complex in the movies or the books. Yes, the movies cut out detail. What movie doesn't? And I've been hard pressed to find a movie I actually enjoyed more than reading the book. But the book snobs on this sub are ridiculous. 

The movies are absolutely beloved. Harry Potter movie marathons are played all the time. The movies were record setting. And think of all the book-to-movies that were not good at all! While I found the movies to be lackluster I still find myself catching one of those movie marathons. I still find myself owning the DVDs (I bet you do too). 

And as technology grows and grows and more time spaces out; you know we are going to get a remake of the movies at some point. Perhaps mini-series; or a streaming special. 

I absolutely loved growing up with the Harry Potter books and movies. I reread all the books last summer and still found that same enjoyment.

,harrypotter,"I see a lot of fics and some posts about what if Neville was the boy who lived,most of these have Neville follow the same events that Harry and the trio did just with Ginny and Luna. I also see what if Harry had died in GOF. In half of these,it’s just Neville taking over doing all the things that Harry and the trio did,just Ginny and Luna are the trio. However imo this wouldn’t be accurate.

If Voldemort had gone after Neville, there are certain factors we would have to think about: Was it his mum or dad who would protect him, would he still live with his grandma? Would he grow up away from all the fame like Harry?

If it was his dad who did it, he most likely would grow up with his grandma,which I think would leave with worse with his fears cause of the pressure. He would grow up hearing how he was the boy who lived, he would defeat Voldemort. Maybe even have dumbledore visit him. 

His friends wouldn’t be Ginny and Luna , he only met them through the DA , which isn’t until 5th year. I don’t think hermione would ever become his close friend,as she just wouldn’t have the patience in her first year(not hermione/Neville  bashing) I’m not saying Neville is an idiot ,hermione just wouldnt have time for his insecurities,something that she got a lot better at overtime, I still think Ron would become friends with Harry, they just have so chemistry, I also think hermione would be the same if they manage to become friends,which the hard part. Anyway, how does Neville do all these things on his own? Easy answer: he can’t AT THIS STAGE.

The thing that set Harry apart is that after all those years he still had the courage, he had the courage to go battle a troll, to go get the stone (I also think he would of been much much much more insecure and wouldn’t done have the things he did with out Ron and hermione but anyway) Neville needed support and that’s totally okay, he wouldn’t have been ready like many 11 year olds. Neville could have done all this maybe in this 3rd year? I don’t really know? The DA really helped him cause he was getting positive  support from harry.

Harry would have grown up loved,with the mum and dad and Sirius and Remus,I think he still would of gone to gryfinndor to please his parents more than avoiding slytherin, he would be more confident and know he has a family, he wouldn’t be as close to the Weasleys, however I see Ron becoming close the potters, to not feel insecure at his home cause he wasn’t special enough. Hermione would form a bond with lily since there both muggleborn, are smart etc

I don’t think lily and snape would of reconciled they were just to far gone and Harry would of taken the brunt of it but never told his mum in fear of there being a fight.

&lt;p&gt;Harry would have grown up loved,with the mum and dad and Sirius and Remus,I think he still would of gone to gryfinndor to please his parents more than avoiding slytherin, he would be more confident and know he has a family, he wouldn’t be as close to the Weasleys, however I see Ron becoming close the potters, to not feel insecure at his home cause he wasn’t special enough. Hermione would form a bond with lily since there both muggleborn, are smart etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think lily and snape would of reconciled they were just to far gone and Harry would of taken the brunt of it but never told his mum in fear of there being a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Harry had died in GOF, that’s it. Neville can’t be a backup cause the prophecy. Harry died and Voldemort won. He hasn’t marked Neville as his equal so he just wins&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"So, we always see critiques of the films about some book moments that aren't included, or the infamous ""Dumbledore said, **calmly**"", but I don't really see a lot of appreciation, so thought I'd just go through why all the films are just awesome, and why I can't pick a worst or best.

Philosophers Stone - introduction to the series, so much warmth, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and the Great Hall, and it is just such a heart warming film to watch and was done so well.

Chamber of Secrets - once again, just so warm and it was great to see the Burrow, the scene with the Cornish pixies was amazing, as was the acromantula scene and polyjuice potion scene, and the basilisk scene was so entertaining to watch, and Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Lockhart was just awesome.

Prisoner of Azkaban - cinematography = AMAZING, I loved all those exterior shots, and I loved seeing the Hogwarts students in normal muggle clothes, and the whole shrieking shack scene has had me glued to the screen every time I watch the movie.

Goblet of Fire - really cool to see all the teenager stuff Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through like dating, and the scene with Voldemort returning and Cedric's death was done SO well, I could feel Harry's shock and fear just radiating through the screen.

Order of the Phoenix - I've seen a lot of people say this is the worst movie, but I can't see why. Imelda Staunton played Umbridge brilliantly, and the scene with Fred and George and the fireworks was so fun to watch. Daniel portrays Harry's difficulty over dealing with what happened last year really well, and Harry's anger is of course understandable, the poor guy has really had a traumatic life, and of course, we know he's only going to go through more trauma. The battle at the Ministry was just... I have no words. It was amazing, and of course Sirius's death was heartbreaking, and the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was just... WOAH.

Half-Blood Prince - once again, really entertaining to see the average teenager sides of the Golden Trio, and the scene with the fire at the Burrow was so entertaining, and Dumbledore's death scene was so dramatic and dark and just done so well (I am aware that I am repeating ""so well"" a lot, it has become clear to me through writing this post that my vocabulary is a lot more limited than I thought), and Tom Felton portrayed Draco's fear really well as well, and Bellatrix in the Great Hall was done amazingly.

Deathly Hallows Part 1 - the 7 Harry's scene was so entertaining to watch, the wedding was fun, then seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione trying to hunt down the Horcruxes and facing obstacles was really entertaining, and with the whole fight scene between Ron and Harry, Emma, Dan, and Rupert all did that really well. Just want to say, about the dance between Harry and Hermione after Ron left, I know some people see that as Harry and Hermione being romantic, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Harry sees his friend is upset and awkwardly tries to make her feel better. There is no romantic tension, just two friends dancing around, trying to distract themselves from what is going on in the world around them. Finally, the Malfoy Manor scene was done really well, and Hermione's torture was heartbreaking, Emma did a really good job.

Deathly Hallows Part 2 - what can I say? The end of the series, I loved the dragon scene, and I just need to express the cinematography of the battle of hogwarts. I mean, it was absolutely beautifully done, the shield around Hogwarts, the death eaters breaking it, the battle as a whole, AHH, just loved it. And the music was also beautiful, and added so much to the movie. Harry meeting Voldemort in the forbidden forest, Harry fighting and killing Voldemort, the movie as a whole. I honestly have no words, it was just an amazing climax to the series.

,harrypotter,"There's always been something that bothers me about Hermione's portrayal in the movies that I haven't been able to articulate until recently.

In the books, Hermione can be really *mean.* But that aspect of her personality is only shown, at best, in parts of the first film, before stripping away not just her mean streak, but most of her self-confidence.

In PoA, there are a *lot* of harsh and tactless comments that Hermione makes towards Ron that the film cut out.

In GoF, Hermione doesn't really care about Ron's jealousy during the Yule Ball and she has a great time. The movie added that bit where she breaks down in tears on the steps.

Perhaps the most succinct example of this is this one line in Order of the Phoenix, present in both the book and the film:

&gt;“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.

You read that? *""Nastily,""* that's the word used. In the movie, however, Emma Watson says the line so meekly that you can barely hear her, it's like Hermione is afraid to say it.

It's really no wonder that so many people who watched the movies first hated the Ron/Hermione romance. The movies changed it from two stubborn equals sparring with each other to an idiot asshole bullying a girl with self-confidence issues for seven years. Even some people who read the books first have turned against it, and I think that's larely because the movies have replaced the books in the popular consciousness in a lot of ways, since people tend to rewatch movies a lot more than they reread books, and visual images get more stuck in your brain than just your imagination from text.

There's this narrative in the fandom that Emma Watson was absolutely perfect for Hermione and no one else could have played her, but the performance just doesn't reflect that.",t2_8vyrt0y7,False,,0,False,Hermione in the movies is way too.....NICE.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_m466rs,False,dark,0.89,,public,157,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,157,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615670534.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s always been something that bothers me about Hermione&amp;#39;s portrayal in the movies that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to articulate until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the books, Hermione can be really &lt;em&gt;mean.&lt;/em&gt; But that aspect of her personality is only shown, at best, in parts of the first film, before stripping away not just her mean streak, but most of her self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In PoA, there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of harsh and tactless comments that Hermione makes towards Ron that the film cut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GoF, Hermione doesn&amp;#39;t really care about Ron&amp;#39;s jealousy during the Yule Ball and she has a great time. The movie added that bit where she breaks down in tears on the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most succinct example of this is this one line in Order of the Phoenix, present in both the book and the film:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"Basically every year has 5 girls and 5 boys per house. It's never mentioned, but it's assumed as you would figure that it would be commented on if the Gryffindors were an anomaly. The five boys in Harry's year are clear, but, famously, there are two mystery Gryffindor girls in his year (speculation on names and identities is widespread, so not for this post). Instead, we see here a problem of scale. The UK wizarding community has one major school. At that school, we see a school with about 70 students graduating each year. A tiny school, really. 

1) Why do they need a whole castle? Even if you consider the living spaces, this is a tiny school population. Even if you consider people taught at home, it's tiny. 

2) A ministry of magic with a widescale operation? For a population only large enough to have 70 graduates at their only real school? Towns with high schools with 70 students graduating have a mayor who probably owns a store in town. Maybe a three-person city council. Maybe. But a whole ministry? You'd need every single graduate to live for a hundred years or more and then to also work in the ministry to justify the scale we see in the books. And even then, it's not at all enough.

3) Everyone knows Stan Shunpike, a guy who works on a bus. Stan at the Leaky Cauldron. The one wand salesman. This indicates that the world is pretty darn small. There's one bank, one bookstore, one robe shop, etc. We get no hint that, outside of maybe Hogsmead, there's a larger world. I briefly lived in a town of 4000 that had five banks and no hospitals. The wizarding world is half that size and has one bank and a full-scale hospital. It doesn't add up. 

It's why the first three books and the last three books seem to be in two different universes. The student body needs to be drastically larger, but, even as small as it is, we still have two mystery girls in Harry's own house.

Instead, we see here a problem of scale. The UK wizarding community has one major school. At that school, we see a school with about 70 students graduating each year. A tiny school, really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Why do they need a whole castle? Even if you consider the living spaces, this is a tiny school population. Even if you consider people taught at home, it&amp;#39;s tiny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) A ministry of magic with a widescale operation? For a population only large enough to have 70 graduates at their only real school? Towns with high schools with 70 students graduating have a mayor who probably owns a store in town. Maybe a three-person city council. Maybe. But a whole ministry? You&amp;#39;d need every single graduate to live for a hundred years or more and then to also work in the ministry to justify the scale we see in the books. And even then, it&amp;#39;s not at all enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Everyone knows Stan Shunpike, a guy who works on a bus. Stan at the Leaky Cauldron. The one wand salesman. This indicates that the world is pretty darn small. There&amp;#39;s one bank, one bookstore, one robe shop, etc. We get no hint that, outside of maybe Hogsmead, there&amp;#39;s a larger world. I briefly lived in a town of 4000 that had five banks and no hospitals. The wizarding world is half that size and has one bank and a full-scale hospital. It doesn&amp;#39;t add up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why the first three books and the last three books seem to be in two different universes. The student body needs to be drastically larger, but, even as small as it is, we still have two mystery girls in Harry&amp;#39;s own house. The quaintness of the school and the sprawling world outside can&amp;#39;t both exist.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not sure whether I think it deserves to be in the genre canon of LotR, SW, etc, but it was definitely an enjoyable read and I'm glad I finally got over myself to do this.

My Goodreads Ratings
Sorcerer's Stone: ***
Chamber of Secrets: ****
Prisoner of Azkaban: ****
Goblet of Fire: *****
Order of the Phoenix: ***
Half-Blood Prince: *****
Deathly Hallows: ****

The highlights of the series for me were Goblet of Fire and Half-Blood Prince. Both were solid stories that had good through line driving the main story from beginning to end. Azkaban would come next. My biggest issue with it is that I think entirely too much of the story hinges on exposition given in the Shrieking Shack. If that had been spread out a bit more or more clues dropped along the way it would be up there with 4 and 6. Chamber of Secrets was the book I knew the most about going into it from having seen at least of the movie in snippets over the years, but that didn't dampen my enjoyment of it. I've been surprised that it seems many think it is the weakest of the series because I enjoy it a lot more than Sorcerer's Stone.

Order of the Phoenix was a pretty big disappointment because it's sitting between two much better books and all of the characters just seem to act dumb all the way through. There's not enough of a consistent through line compared to the better books. I think she really started pulling her punches here. It was somewhat unbelievable that so many wizards could be trying to kill each other and only one ends up dying. It's entirely possible that my enjoyment was somewhat less because it seemed very topical at the time I was reading it. The Ministry denying the return of Voldemort felt extremely similar to me to a certain president thinking they had won an election in terms of how both were so far divorced from reality. This is the chapter in which I think the movie improves on many aspects. The Ministry of Magic and the battle at the end of the story was much more impressive to me on film than it was on the page. I've not yet watched the last 3 movies.

Deathly Hallows was a mixed bag and the book I'm still trying to make up my mind about. It doesn't feel to me like she had the actual mechanics of the endgame mapped out well enough. I think if she had then some of Dumbledore's history would have fit better in book 6 alongside the histories of Voldemort and Snape. The search for the horcruxes is a nice extension from book 6, but the Hallows seem to come out of nowhere. The Battle of Hogwarts is ultimately fairly satisfying but again she pulls her punches with there being only 3 named characters amongst the rows and rows of dead in the Great Hall. The logic behind the ownership of the Elder Wand also leaves something to be desired. I think I have finally gotten my head wrapped around it but it took a lot of thought and conversation with multiple other people to really figure it out. And finally it was probably too much to expect, but I think it would have been a much stronger ending if she had allowed Harry to stay dead. The logic of the prophecy and how he is able to come back from the dead again is another one that strains the mind. It could have been worked around by allowing Neville to ultimately vanquish Voldemort following Harry's final sacrifice.

I'm still trying to decide whether I think JKR was any good at planning ahead or just really good at taking old stuff and making it fit what she needed (diary later becomes Horcrux, Dumbledore tells Harry Voldemort cannot die, mention of Grindelwald in book 1). I've been listening to the Binge Mode HP podcasts since finishing the series (currently on book 3) and they seem to think it was good planning. I think the biggest argument against JKR being good at planning is that the Deathly Hallows is not mentioned at all until book 7.

,harrypotter,"Rereading the books for the first time in a long while, and just finished the first one. Spoilers ahead.

The final chapter of the book is titled ""The Man With Two Faces"". Obviously this is referring to Quirrel who turns out is not who he seems to be, and also literally has a second face on the back of his head.

But this time around it struck me that is not the only man with two faces in this chapter. After his confrontation with Quirrel, Harry wakes up in the hospital and has a lengthy conversation with Dumbledore. Dumbledore at first seems like a kind, wise old man who always has everyone's best interest in mind, though later on in the series we come to realize this isn't necessarily the case. He has a habit of concealing the truth from people and sort of uses them to achieve greater ends.

Hermione even mentions in this chapter that Dumbledore may not be so noble as he seems at first. Harry says something like ""I think Dumbledore intended for me to go after the stone."" To which Hermione replies ""That's really terrible! You could have died!"" And she's right. Dumbledore had no way of knowing that the trio would make it through the ordeal ok, and should never have left the school if he thought they were going after the stone. Especially if Dumbledore suspected Voldemort was involved.

But even further than that Snape is revealed in this chapter to also be two-faced!  Throughout the book he's a bitter mean-spirited bully, but in this chapter Dumbledore reveals that Snape is in fact a decent person at heart.

,harrypotter,"To me half blood prince book is a masterpiece. Its my second favourite book in the series and closely second. This a alot of hp fans least favourite movie and I can understand but the criticisms feel oddly similar when someone reviews this movie. Doesn't mean that the review is bad it just feels like deja vu sometimes, but me I wanna focus on the stuff that I just despised in this movie and without further ado let us begin.

**1. DRACO MALFOY**

For real Half of this movie is basically just sad Draco scenes and I hate it. For context Draco is one of my least favourite characters, I really hate him so much. But in this book, he's the most interesting I love his plan in this book and harry's obsession with Draco, its so fun to read. His full entire plan is not even shown in the movie, we don't see him using crabbe and Goyle at all or him putting the imperious curse on rosmerta, and that annoys me to death. Its so much fun seeing all of this stuff just unravel in the end, its like such a amazing moment seeing his full plan come together seeing him explain it to Dumbledore and  without it, it just kinda makes Dumbledore's death scene kinda pointless. In the books the chapter is not just Dumbledore dying, Its Draco's plan that gets told and everything all the little clues in the books, start to make sense. All the books have this its used best in POA and GOF, but idk man something about it being here is amazing. Draco In the other movies didn't really feel like a threat at all, I mean even in this one he just seems sad and mopey and he's ''misunderstood'' like wtf. Draco used the unforgivable curse on an innocent lady, almost used crucio on harry, let death eaters into the castle, scarred bills face, tried to poison Dumbledore but poisoned Ron instead and gave Katie bell a cursed necklace. But he's still the '''misunderstood''' wtf, And yes I am blaming the movie for this bcz they don't show him as evil as he was in the books.

**2. HARRY AND DUMBLEDORE**

This book had a job to make harry and Dumbledore's relationship feel genuine so harry can feel betrayed by him in the next book. But in this movie harry and Dumbledore just seem like how they were in like book 1. In this book harry becomes Dumbledore's man through and through ( a line they left out of the movie wtf) Dumbledore and harry becomes more than just a student and headmaster relationship, no line exemplifies this better than this line:

*“I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.”*

This is right after what happened in the cave for context, Dumbledore just relived his worst memory ever, fought off inferi, is weak as Frick and he still puts his trust In harry. What a legend, The movie however is not interested in any of this stuff and throws it out the window. ( same thing they did in DH) Its like do the filmmakers even care about Dumbledore and harry? I don't think so and that is unacceptable. Harry and Dumbledore's relationship is what defines book 6 for me, after not talking to harry for almost year, Dumbledore need to reconnect with harry and reconnect he does. Cutting this out is way too stupid and I will never understand why they did it or why nobody even cares.

**3. SEVERUS SNAPE**

I don't want to a Snape debate so lets just forget about that. This book is truly when harry hates Snape. This is the books when he hear about the fact that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy, and is furious and to top it all of he kills Dumbledore. Might I add what an amazing scene Imma talk about more but damn I love Dumbledore's death. The fact that harry saw the half blood prince book as a friend more than a guide really says something, he trusted that book to help him with his potions work, even used it to save Ron and used it to get Slughorn's memory. And when harry finds out its actually Snape who was it its an amazing reveal and I love it so much. The movie doesn't really earn that reveal, they barely mention the half blood prince and Snape isn't as mean or cruel as he is in the books. So it makes it feel like a throw away line, when its not. The book is called the half blood prince, why did anyone think it was a good idea to cut this out? its a fucking disgrace. They butchered the book. They ruined it. 

**4. HARRY'S OBSESSION**

In the entire series, This is in the only book where harry is actually right and I love that. Nobody believes him or cares enough to believe. Tonks, Mr Weasley, Lupin, Dumbledore, Mcgonnagoll, Ron, Hermione didn't believe him with his Draco death eater theory and the fact that he was right, makes the reveal much more sad and impactful, Think about it in all the other books harry was wrong.

Book 1: harry thinks Snape is stealing the stone

Book 2: harry thinks Draco is the heir of Slytherin

Book 3: harry thinks Sirius is bad

Book 4: harry thinks karkaroff put his name in the goblet

Book 5: harry thinks Voldemort is after a weapon

Book 7: harry thinks the deathly hallows symbol is an eye

But in book 6, harry was right. I don't really get that same feeling in the movie though, because they barely focus on it. Harry doesn't camp outside the room of requirement, he doesn't send Kreacher and Dobby, he doesn't watch the marauders map constantly looking for Draco, he doesn't eavesdrop on him during the apparition lessons, he doesn't send Ron and Hermione to check the castle when he leaves to go with Dumbledore, You see my point? none of this is included. That just kinda makes this movie feel like a disgrace to the book which it is. This movie is falling apart hard, like really hard.

**5. THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER**

This is one of my favourite chapters in the entire series. I Love this chapter so much its honestly beautiful, lets see how the movie holds up. Why the hell does Dumbledore apparate on the astronomy tower? out of all places that bruh. In the books harry's under the cloak and he's frozen in place so that he has to watch everything, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape. He could not move or talk, he can only watch. Dumbledore will never help harry again, he'll never explain anything to him ever again, he won't see the piercing blue eyes anymore. The movie doesn't feel like that, we don't get to see the full extent of harry and Dumbledore's relationship, they just seem like headmaster and student and not friends. After everything that happened that night, he heard Dumbledore begging for death, he heard the full extent of Draco's plan, he saw the dark mark in the sky and thought someone died, Hearing Dumbledore begging for mercy to Snape, scared harry more than anything that he ever experienced that night, that shook harry to the core, even just hearing the line ''Severus please'' brings me to tears every time. The movie doesn't really have that same feeling, it should have it but it doesn't. And even after Dumbledore died and harry saw his body the locket was open, and he found out that Dumbledore had died for nothing, they didn't get the horcrux. Now that is truly heartbreaking and for the first time in the series harry starts to cry. Its weird seeing our main character break down like this and worst of all, when Fawkes plays a lament to honour Dumbledore, even though he never hear the song, you can still feel the emotion. The movie is not like this at all it ruins everything that made this book so powerful ad heartbreaking, and I hate it for that. This line always bring me to tears when I read this book too:

*And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.*

Reading the ending of this book solidified this as my second favourite book of all time, but the movie doesn't even come close to the level of brilliance of this book. It never can and will, is the half blood prince a disgrace to the book? Yes. It deserves this rating of...

Its my second favourite book in the series and closely second. This a alot of hp fans least favourite movie and I can understand but the criticisms feel oddly similar when someone reviews this movie. Doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the review is bad it just feels like deja vu sometimes, but me I wanna focus on the stuff that I just despised in this movie and without further ado let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. DRACO MALFOY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For real Half of this movie is basically just sad Draco scenes and I hate it. For context Draco is one of my least favourite characters, I really hate him so much. But in this book, he&amp;#39;s the most interesting I love his plan in this book and harry&amp;#39;s obsession with Draco, its so fun to read. His full entire plan is not even shown in the movie, we don&amp;#39;t see him using crabbe and Goyle at all or him putting the imperious curse on rosmerta, and that annoys me to death. Its so much fun seeing all of this stuff just unravel in the end, its like such a amazing moment seeing his full plan come together seeing him explain it to Dumbledore and  without it, it just kinda makes Dumbledore&amp;#39;s death scene kinda pointless. In the books the chapter is not just Dumbledore dying, Its Draco&amp;#39;s plan that gets told and everything all the little clues in the books, start to make sense. All the books have this its used best in POA and GOF, but idk man something about it being here is amazing. Draco In the other movies didn&amp;#39;t really feel like a threat at all, I mean even in this one he just seems sad and mopey and he&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;&amp;#39;misunderstood&amp;#39;&amp;#39; like wtf. Draco used the unforgivable curse on an innocent lady, almost used crucio on harry, let death eaters into the castle, scarred bills face, tried to poison Dumbledore but poisoned Ron instead and gave Katie bell a cursed necklace. But he&amp;#39;s still the &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;misunderstood&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; wtf, And yes I am blaming the movie for this bcz they don&amp;#39;t show him as evil as he was in the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. HARRY AND DUMBLEDORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book had a job to make harry and Dumbledore&amp;#39;s relationship feel genuine so harry can feel betrayed by him in the next book. But in this movie harry and Dumbledore just seem like how they were in like book 1. In this book harry becomes Dumbledore&amp;#39;s man through and through ( a line they left out of the movie wtf) Dumbledore and harry becomes more than just a student and headmaster relationship, no line exemplifies this better than this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am not worried, Harry,&amp;quot; said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. &amp;quot;I am with you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is right after what happened in the cave for context, Dumbledore just relived his worst memory ever, fought off inferi, is weak as Frick and he still puts his trust In harry. What a legend, The movie however is not interested in any of this stuff and throws it out the window. ( same thing they did in DH) Its like do the filmmakers even care about Dumbledore and harry? I don&amp;#39;t think so and that is unacceptable. Harry and Dumbledore&amp;#39;s relationship is what defines book 6 for me, after not talking to harry for almost year, Dumbledore need to reconnect with harry and reconnect he does. Cutting this out is way too stupid and I will never understand why they did it or why nobody even cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. SEVERUS SNAPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to a Snape debate so lets just forget about that. This book is truly when harry hates Snape. This is the books when he hear about the fact that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy, and is furious and to top it all of he kills Dumbledore. Might I add what an amazing scene Imma talk about more but damn I love Dumbledore&amp;#39;s death. The fact that harry saw the half blood prince book as a friend more than a guide really says something, he trusted that book to help him with his potions work, even used it to save Ron and used it to get Slughorn&amp;#39;s memory. And when harry finds out its actually Snape who was it its an amazing reveal and I love it so much. The movie doesn&amp;#39;t really earn that reveal, they barely mention the half blood prince and Snape isn&amp;#39;t as mean or cruel as he is in the books. So it makes it feel like a throw away line, when its not. The book is called the half blood prince, why did anyone think it was a good idea to cut this out? its a fucking disgrace. They butchered the book. They ruined it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. HARRY&amp;#39;S OBSESSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the entire series, This is in the only book where harry is actually right and I love that. Nobody believes him or cares enough to believe. Tonks, Mr Weasley, Lupin, Dumbledore, Mcgonnagoll, Ron, Hermione didn&amp;#39;t believe him with his Draco death eater theory and the fact that he was right, makes the reveal much more sad and impactful, Think about it in all the other books harry was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 1: harry thinks Snape is stealing the stone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 2: harry thinks Draco is the heir of Slytherin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 3: harry thinks Sirius is bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 4: harry thinks karkaroff put his name in the goblet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 5: harry thinks Voldemort is after a weapon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 7: harry thinks the deathly hallows symbol is an eye&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in book 6, harry was right. I don&amp;#39;t really get that same feeling in the movie though, because they barely focus on it. Harry doesn&amp;#39;t camp outside the room of requirement, he doesn&amp;#39;t send Kreacher and Dobby, he doesn&amp;#39;t watch the marauders map constantly looking for Draco, he doesn&amp;#39;t eavesdrop on him during the apparition lessons, he doesn&amp;#39;t send Ron and Hermione to check the castle when he leaves to go with Dumbledore, You see my point? none of this is included. That just kinda makes this movie feel like a disgrace to the book which it is. This movie is falling apart hard, like really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite chapters in the entire series. I Love this chapter so much its honestly beautiful, lets see how the movie holds up. Why the hell does Dumbledore apparate on the astronomy tower? out of all places that bruh. In the books harry&amp;#39;s under the cloak and he&amp;#39;s frozen in place so that he has to watch everything, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape. He could not move or talk, he can only watch. Dumbledore will never help harry again, he&amp;#39;ll never explain anything to him ever again, he won&amp;#39;t see the piercing blue eyes anymore. The movie doesn&amp;#39;t feel like that, we don&amp;#39;t get to see the full extent of harry and Dumbledore&amp;#39;s relationship, they just seem like headmaster and student and not friends. After everything that happened that night, he heard Dumbledore begging for death, he heard the full extent of Draco&amp;#39;s plan, he saw the dark mark in the sky and thought someone died, Hearing Dumbledore begging for mercy to Snape, scared harry more than anything that he ever experienced that night, that shook harry to the core, even just hearing the line &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Severus please&amp;#39;&amp;#39; brings me to tears every time. The movie doesn&amp;#39;t really have that same feeling, it should have it but it doesn&amp;#39;t. And even after Dumbledore died and harry saw his body the locket was open, and he found out that Dumbledore had died for nothing, they didn&amp;#39;t get the horcrux. Now that is truly heartbreaking and for the first time in the series harry starts to cry. Its weird seeing our main character break down like this and worst of all, when Fawkes plays a lament to honour Dumbledore, even though he never hear the song, you can still feel the emotion. The movie is not like this at all it ruins everything that made this book so powerful ad heartbreaking, and I hate it for that. This line always bring me to tears when I read this book too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the ending of this book solidified this as my second favourite book of all time, but the movie doesn&amp;#39;t even come close to the level of brilliance of this book. It never can and will, is the half blood prince a disgrace to the book? Yes. It deserves this rating of...&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"So I obviously knew what Harry Potter was before this binge. I watched a few of them sporadically throughout my childhood, but never really followed the story (to be fair, I don’t think most children really did) 

Fast forward to last month, I was on holiday for school and just thought I’d binge all the movies. I’ve never read the books (have never been much of a reader, but when I have gotten the occasional book I like in English class, I get hooked) Binged all eight movies in less than a week, then binged them again right after. I was just so addicted. Although I’ve seen people say they can’t imagine following the story without reading the books, I felt so connected to the characters, even with their apparently noticeable flaws (from the books)

I had two “questions” I hope to get answered in this post. Firstly, should I get into the books? I feel like the obvious answer is yes, but did I kind of ruin it by watching the movies first? Or will I still be able to enjoy it and learn the characters again, as I’ve been told again and again that they’re all better in the books. Secondly, how do you guys cope with this not being real? I know it’s basic to say you wish a fictional story was real, etc. but seriously. I watched the “As the World Caves In” and “Sign of the Times” mixes on YouTube and cried every time.

,harrypotter,"Once upon a time a couple months ago, yours truly thought it would be cool to see how a book would read when only reading what people shout in all caps. Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHOD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will happen tonight. (Trelawney)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight…the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than he ever was.

""This one seems...familiar"" the voice continued. He could feel his heart beating against the inside of his chest. This couldn't be real, he thought. ""Oh, but it *is* real!"" the voice replied, almost as though it had heard him think. This time the boy jumped from the shock. 

*'Can you hear my thoughts?'* he said aloud in his mind. ""Your thoughts, yes, but much more than that, boy"" said the voice. ""I can see you, too. Who you are, who you might be, all the potential deep within..."" The boy took a steadying breath. Then, again in his mind, he spoke. *'You can see who I am?'* His own voice sounded unsure in his head, for the boy really didn't know who he was himself when he thought about it. 

""I can."" replied the voice. It was a soft, yet confident voice with a sharpness to it that suggested wisdom and maturity. ""I see promise, oh yes, such promise. Nearly fearless too, except for that..."" The boy screwed up his face at this. *'I am NOT scared of anything!'* he thought defiantly. 

But the voice continued on, undeterred. ""You'd make a good leader, a great one even. But there's more to you isn't there? A strong desire to prove yourself, to show the world what you can be."" Now the boy just sat, quite still, listening intently. He was starting to like what he heard, and with it he relaxed a little. As he did so, he subconsciously opened more of himself up to the all-encompassing darkness surrounding him. 

""What's this?"" the voice said softly ""You don't just want to show the world... You want to bend it to your will."" The boy said nothing in his head, but allowed memories to bubble to the surface. Memories of the people who had already seen that part of him, of people who *would* see that part of him one day. 

""I haven't seen a mind like this in almost a thousand years..."" said the voice, only now it wasn't so confident. It almost seemed fearful, as if it had seen something in this small boy that ought not to have been seen. Centuries seemed to pass by in an instant, a rushing, roaring sound rose up, dreadful in the blackness and the boy felt his heart racing, but this time it was an altogether different sensation. A rush of adrenaline that made him feel giddy. The voice understood now not just who this boy was, but why he seemed so familiar too. 

""Salazar..."" it said, in a hushed, quiet tone before roaring ""SLYTHERIN!"" out loud to the great hall. 

The boy blinked in the sudden bright light, before hurrying over to the Slytherin table where the green and silver clad students erupted in cheers.

Ron makes no attempt to stop the kiss and embraces it, instead.\n* \\[[10](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=105)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / After Hermione runs away from the shock of seeing Ron kissing another girl, Ron gleefully skips through the halls with Lavender Brown and stumbles upon a weeping Hermione. Though he sees she is distraught, Ron doesn\'t apologize or show remorse or even abandon his frivolity with Lavender. He sees that his actions have hurt Hermione and he continues to run off with Lavender.\n\nYet, despite being treated so horribly, Hermione decides *""yeah, this sounds like a perfectly stable foundation for a relationship”* and marries him. I always wondered, where did the connection between them happen?\n\nBut upon watching the films again recently, I noticed something that I hadn\'t paid much attention to before. In the Deathly Hallows part 2, Ron Weasley performs the [**Imperius** **curse**](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse) on Bogrod, the goblin teller.\n\n* \\[[11](https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / During the scene where the trio break into Gringotts, Ron Weasley effortlessly uses the Imperius Curse on Bogrod, the goblin teller, without hesitation. Bogrod remains under the effects of the Imperius curse until his own demise at the fiery breath of the security dragon.\n\nWhen cast successfully, the Imperius Curse places the victim completely under the caster’s control (unless the victim is strong enough to resist it) and it is one of three Unforgivable Curses that witches and wizards are forbidden to use.\n\nSo why does Ron Weasley know this curse?\n\nAt first, I thought he must have originally learned about it during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson about the Unforgivable Curses in the Goblet of Fire. But when I watched the scene again, I found out that **I was wrong**.\n\nRon actually already knew about the Imperius Curse prior to Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson, and he learned it from his father, Arthur Weasley.\n\n* \\[[12](https://youtu.be/wsl5fS7KGZc)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / In the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Mad-Eye Moody provides a lesson about the three Unforgivable Curses, and he calls upon Ron to volunteer the name of one of the curses. Out of all three curses, Ron provides the Imperius Curse and says that he learned it from his father, thus showing he was already familiar with the curse.\n\nWhich leads us to our next question. When did Ron practice using the spell to be good enough to charm a goblin teller?\n\nCasting a spell in the wizarding world is not as simple as waving a wand and reading the incantation. If that were true, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wouldn’t be nearly as threatening. As we’ve seen in the films, the ability to successfully perform any spell comes the same way any good skill does – through practice and proper form.\n\n* \\[[13](https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / The students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, demonstrating that casting magic is not as simple as wand-waving and word-mumbling. Without the proper technique, a spell’s effects can have alternate (disastrous) results.\n* \\[[14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Professor Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to mend Harry’s broken arm and fails (further proving that spells are not successful if they are cast by someone who has no idea what they are doing).\n* \\[[15](https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Harry trains with Professor Lupin to learn the Patronus Charm, but Harry is not quite able to cast the spell effectively right away. Even Chosen Ones have to practice to *git guud*.\n\nYou might be thinking, *“But Harry also* [*cast the Imperius Curse*](https://youtu.be/F9KyOu_RchU?t=186) *on a goblin and I’m sure he wasn’t running around practicing it on random folks. Maybe it’s just an easier spell to cast?”*\n\nHarry has demonstrated (on multiple occasions) a talent for spell mastery due to his unique circumstances. I would argue that part of the reason Harry was able to cast the Imperius Curse so effectively in the Deathly Hallows part 2 without prior training is because he is Voldemort’s Horcrux, and thus, inherits some of the Dark Lord’s abilities (as evidenced through Harry’s ability to speak [parseltongue](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue)). Otherwise, if the curse were really so easy to cast, why wouldn’t anyone just cast it for anything?\n\nWith that understanding, we have a reasonable guess as to why Harry can cast the curse so easily, but Ron doesn’t have any ties to the Dark Lord or the ability to master spells easily. Ron has, in fact, been historically slower at learning spells.\n\nSo, when (or **on whom**) did Ron practice the curse to become so effective at it?\n\nHe practiced it on Hermione Granger, which explains why she suddenly fell in love with him. Think about it. Ron was a jerk to Hermione across multiple films and then suddenly she’s all over him, being giddy around him, staying at his house, and calling him brilliant.\n\n*“What?! No. Ron would never do that. He might have picked on Hermione but that’s not exactly evidence that he would do something so evil as to brainwash a friend.”*\n\nOh ho-ho. Strap in, because there is evidence suggesting Ron is actually a lot darker-minded than we realized. But first, let’s talk about motive. Why would Ron even want to mind-control Hermione?\n\nIt’s because he’s jealous of her affection for Harry and is tired of being in Harry’s shadow.\n\n*“Riddikulus!”*\n\nI’m not a Boggart; that won’t work on me!\n\n*“But Hermione wasn’t attracted to Harry.”*\n\nActually, there are multiple signs that Hermione might have been initially sweet on Harry.\n\n* \\[[16](https://youtu.be/b6eIgrYraEc?t=175)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / After Hermione repairs Harry’s glasses, she recognizes him, even though they had never officially met. Harry’s scar is not visible during this scene, so she would not have recognized him via his scar but of photographs of him. Simple moments of infatuation like this are often the foundation of young crushes that lead to romantic interests.\n* \\[[17](https://youtu.be/DfjM5SUkPPg)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Harry is reunited with Hermione in Diagon Alley while shopping for school supplies, where she ends up repairing his glasses once again and does so with a warm smile and bright eyes.

While this can be attributed to Hermione feeling bad about Harry\'s situation, the way she lingers can also be a sign that she likes him and wished him to be there with her.\n* \\[[20](https://youtu.be/R5xJbQL1eHo?t=154)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / During a quidditch match, Harry is attacked by a Dementor and falls unconscious.

She locks eyes with Harry the entire time and even plays with her hair, which can be seen as a sign of infatuation.\n* \\[[21](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=47)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / When the Quidditch World Cup game is attacked, Hermione fearfully calls out for Harry several times (while being dragged away by Ron).\n* \\[[22](https://youtu.be/JMrQ4uE4j84)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / Just before the first trial, Hermione enters the Champions\' tent and lovingly embraces Harry out of fear and worry.\n* \\[[23](https://youtu.be/K-tLdA55c3k?t=242)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / After the second trial, Hermione rushes to check on Harry and even gives him a kiss on the head.

When Ron dismisses her offer with a snide remark (such husband material), she turns hopefully to Harry and is elated when he says that he will.\n\nThis isn’t just a series of isolated incidents being misinterpreted, either. Even Albus Dumbledore, a powerful wizard with keen intuition and sharp intellect, thought Harry and Hermione might have been together. And even **he** was surprised to hear that Harry and Hermione were not together.\n\n* \\[25\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / When Albus summons Harry to his office the first time in order to ask Harry to gain Professor Slughorn’s trust, he asks if Harry is seeing Hermione romantically.\n\nNow, imagine you’re Ron: You’re the youngest of 5 older brothers who is always in trouble (and being howled at), constantly being teased by your older siblings, and you’re given embarrassing hand-me-down items over the years. To top it all off, you’re a Weasley (a *Weasley*!), [who are looked down](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasley_family) on by other wizard families.

When Ron pushes the issue, they raise the price to ten galleons. Immediately afterward, Ron turns away defeated and says to his friends “Come on, let’s go” in a tone that sounds as if he’s dealt with this type of thing for far too long.\n\nKnow what would make it all worse? If one day, you met a boy who was stupidly famous, obscenely rich, ludicrously successful no matter what he did, and was always the center of everyone’s attention. Then that boy becomes your “best friend”, so that any light of success you have is instantly darkened by his shadow of greatness. Imagine how frustrating that must feel after a few years.\n\n* \\[[34](https://youtu.be/12hxT4URRGU?t=121)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / When Ron first meets Harry on the Hogwarts Express, he is so poor that is he unable to purchase any sweets from the trolley. But Harry flaunts his vast wealth by purchasing the entire trolley of sweets. This would be awesome for young Ron, at first, but eventually this becomes unbearable as he grows older.\n* \\[[35](https://youtu.be/f-XC-Lz2E5w?t=22)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Harry is invited to be on the Quidditch team after barley starting the school year. Some of Ron’s older siblings had been on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and it was shown that Ron was hopeful to follow their footsteps. So it must have burned to see a kid come and take a spot on the team, thinking that it might be just because of his namesake.\n* \\[[36](https://youtu.be/gq0E5QN_mvo?t=66)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Harry is gifted the Nimbus 2000, the best flying broom in the entire school (at the time), and the gift was even from a professor. If you were in Ron’s position, you would definitely notice the blatant favoritism shown to Harry Potter.\n\nAnd when you’re always in the shadow of your friend’s glory, you start becoming resentful and jealous, which prompts you to do things that make you feel successful (and in control). On a few occasions, Ron sours on Harry for seemingly no rational reason. Other times, Ron purposefully goes out of his way to keep Hermione away from Harry.\n\n* \\[[37](https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / After it is announced Harry Potter will participate in the incredibly dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, Ron becomes upset with Harry.

Instead of stopping to be a good guy and help his best friend, Ron makes it a priority to drag Hermione away from him.\n* \\[[39](https://youtu.be/bA5cIGdt9j4?t=18)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / On the Hogwarts Express, Hermione expresses concern about Harry while leaving the train but Ron immediately dismisses her concern while urging her to follow him off the train. Ron shows no concern for Harry and is quick to pull Hermione away the minute she asks about Harry.\n\nHarry hasn’t always been the nicest friend to Ron, either.\n\n* \\[[40](https://youtu.be/ktfsgXyRbuc?t=38)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Ron attempts to console a brooding Harry and is harshly pushed away. This occurs just moments after Ron nobly defends Harry to a group of troubled Gryffindor members. This may very well have been the moment where Ron realizes that he is worthless.\n\nBut the most damning evidence of all, the one that shows us the true thoughts that plague Ron Weasley’s mind, is in the Deathly Hallows when Slytherin’s Locket, one of Voldemort’s seven Horcruxes, reveals his darkest fears and anxieties. It reinforces all of the evidence we just reviewed – that Ron feels inferior to Harry, that he feels that his family doesn’t love him, and that he’ll never have a girl like Hermione because of Harry.\n\n* \\[[41](https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / When Harry opens Slytherin’s Locket so that Ron can destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor, the locket speaks to Ron with dark whispers from his own heart. When the locket is first opened it says, *“I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.”* Among the truths we learn about Ron through the locket are that:\n* o Ron’s mother wanted a daughter.\n* o Ron’s mother once admitted that she would have preferred Harry as a son.\n* o The locket’s shadow of Hermione also said, “Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared to the Chosen One?”\n\nKeep in mind, Slytherin’s Locket could be lying in order to cripple Ron Weasley’s spirit. But also keep this in mind… If all the locket’s words were complete lies, Ron would never have been paralyzed by them. The fact is, there was truth in the locket’s words. The locket only whispered whatever dark thoughts were already in Ron’s heart. This confirms that Ron was indeed jealous of Harry, indeed frustrated about not being able to “get the girl”, and insecure about his relationship with his family. All of this, added with the other evidence, means that it is absolutely plausible that Ron may have been driven to desperation at one point, whether he meant to or not.\n\nNow that we have a motive, let’s talk about Ron’s proclivity for dark behavior. Even if we might have a plausible motive, surely our sweet Won-Won would never even think about doing something so vile as to mind-control Hermione. Right?\n\nBut actually, he’s shown us that maybe he’s not the most noble Gryffindor.\n\n* \\[[42](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / While eating, Nigel Wolpert delivers a parcel to Ron then awkwardly lingers until Ron dismisses him. When Hermione gives Ron a questioning look, he admits that he promised Nigel Harry’s autograph. Ron basically admitted to securing favors (such as servitude) in exchange for celebrity items, which shows a willingness to use his friendship with Harry to his personal benefit.\n* \\[[43](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner where the trio are deciding what to do with the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley is the first one to unflinchingly suggest murder showing that he clearly has a dark side. When Hermione meekly protests, Ron tries to justify his cruelty. Harry has to be the voice of reason by suggesting an alternate, less criminal solution.\n\nSo now we have a motive, evidence that Ron had knowledge of the curse to carry out the act, and we have seen evidence of Ron’s darker personality.\n\n*“But the Imperius Curse only works on weak-minded wizards. Hermione is definitely not weak. Ron wouldn’t be able to charm someone as strong-willed as her.”*\n\n[Right you are, Harry!](https://youtu.be/sf1dH0Bibyk?t=9) The films have demonstrated Hermione to be a strong wizard, amazingly smart and incredibly skilled in a variety of subjects and skillsets. Normally, I would wager that Hermione would be able to resist the Imperius Curse. Except, Hermione is not always strong willed. In fact, when it comes to her friends, we’ve seen her succumb to their requests before.\n\nIt’s entirely possible that, while Hermione would normally be able to resist an Imperius Curse from anyone else, she’s not as strong willed when it comes to her friends. [Stress can also have negative impacts on a person’s mental and emotional willpower](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/), and we’ve seen Hermione go through a lot of emotional distress with her friends throughout the films, from worrying about Harry’s safety to running off crying because of Ron’s cruel comments. The stress Hermione deals with could have also attributed to her not being able to counter the Imperius Curse.\n\nI believe Ron took advantage of that fact to **groom** Hermione and lower her defenses so that he could successfully curse her.\n\n[Grooming](http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming) is a tactic seen in abusive relationships where a person’s normal defenses (or strong wills) are overcome by slowly desensitizing them to abusive behaviors. It often works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse.\n\n* \\[[44](https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / While Harry is down by the lake with Neville, Hermione approaches Harry with a message from Ron, who is seen standing just a yard behind her. It is clear that Hermione is not thrilled about being used by Ron to deliver a message to a person he is within speaking distance of, but she does so anyway. After failing the first attempt, Hermione attempts to withdraw from the commitment and urges Ron to deliver the message. Ron pushes back and forces Hermione to follow through. Ron\'s choice to force Hermione to carry out such an asinine command can be seen as an attempt by him to assert his authority and will over her. This is considered [manipulation](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html), which is another form of abuse, where the manipulator (Ron) gets the victim to do something they don’t want to do through a variety of techniques.\n* \\[[45](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner, after Harry makes the decision to wipe the memories of the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley approaches Hermione, caresses her face, then tells her to perform the act of wiping the Death Eater\'s memory. This part of a grooming process, where the abuser (Ron) asks their victim (Hermione) to perform various acts that make them feel just as guilty as the abuser. Ron further imposes himself upon Hermione by making physical contact prior to giving a command. Note, that Ron doesn\'t ask Hermione to do it. If he truly cared about her, he would realize that wiping someone\'s memory might be a sensitive subject considering she just had to wipe her parents\' memories. Instead, Ron commands her to do it and Hermione follows through without any protest though it is visibly clear that she is completely uncomfortable with it. This is an example of grooming.\n* \\[[46](https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / While in search of a way to destroy Slytherin’s Locket, the trio take turns carrying the Horcrux. While Ron carries the locket, he starts being overwhelmed by its darkness. Just being near the locket draws out the darkest fears and anxieties of a person. In this case, it happens to be Ron’s jealousy of Hermione. Ron’s jealousy eventually becomes so unbearable that he fights with Harry and then decides to leave. But before doing so, he stops to ask Hermione if she’s staying or going. This is an example of [basic coercive](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html) techniques often used by abusers in relationships where the abuser (Ron) tries to maintain his control by forcing the victim to choose between them or something else. It’s like horrific “all or nothing” scenario where the victim, who clearly has feelings for the abuser, is muddled by the sudden pressure to abruptly make a decision that will have major lasting impacts. Typically, the victim in this situation would surrender to the side of the abuser, because the pressure of making that kind of decision in the moment is too great, and it’s hard for anyone to just walk away. But in this case, we see Hermione actually resist. Interesting how she can do that when she’s not under a mind-controlling curse. It’s clear that Ron’s only method of maintaining relationships is through coercion, manipulation, and mind-control, at this point.\n\nRon just isn’t an insensitive brat, he’s an abusive friend and a manipulator, as well.\n\nThe fact that Hermione is a victim of abuse and a victim of the Imperius Curse becomes even more clear during the Deathly Hallows, when Ron decides to leave out of jealousy. After Ron leaves, Harry and Hermione instantly start connecting, almost as if Hermione changes without Ron’s influence.\n\n* \\[[47](https://youtu.be/GM5WI4MTXzc)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / After Ron has left, some time passes, and Harry and Hermione are sitting alone together in their camping tent when they make a sudden connection. As if Hermione is starting to wake up from a nightmare.\n\nSo, now we have to determine: When did it all happen? At what point did Ron lose himself and do the unthinkable to Hermione?\n\nConsidering all the evidence, I believe, sometime during the Order of the Phoenix, Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger. This is the time we start seeing Hermione hang around Ron a little more closely but she hasn’t quite started falling over him. That happens during the events of the Half-Blood Prince where Hermione is not only sleeping over at Ron’s house a few days before the start of the school year but she’s also looking at him more and becoming incredibly upset when he runs off with other girls.\n\nMore specifically, I believe it may have first occurred during the winter break of the school year during Order of the Phoenix.\n\n* \\[[48](https://youtu.be/-mJqm_ijE6s?t=25)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Inside the House of Black, the Weasleys celebrate the Christmas holiday with the return of Arthur Weasley (who had been previously attacked) and exchange presents. When Ron opens his present, Hermione smiles warmly at Ron. This is odd because in the previous scene, Hermione is digging at Ron with her usual sharp wit. There is seemingly no reason for her to smile at Ron like that during something as simple as unwrapping a present unless something had happened between them. Maybe they cozied up during the winter break? Or maybe, Ron decided he’d had enough of being the sidekick of the group and used the Imperius Curse on Hermione for the first time. This scene occurs after Harry snaps at Ron, who was only trying to help \\[39\\]. Notice, too, in this scene that Hermione does not greet Harry when he arrives. She has typically given Harry big, bright welcomes in the past but here, she only gives him a frowning glance. This could suggest that Ron used the Imperius Curse to also tone-down Hermione’s enthusiasm for Harry.\n\n*“But Hermione doesn’t look like she’s under the influence of the Imperius Curse.”*\n\nThe films have been inconsistent with how the Imperius Curse is represented. For example, in the Goblet of Fire, [victims of the curse are shown to have milky eyes](https://youtu.be/FyqA7eWrFt8?t=123). But during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson on the Unforgiveable Curses \\[12\\], the Professor says that many wizards and witches claimed they only followed Lord Voldemort because they were under the influence of the Imperius Curse, and implied it was a challenge to determine which ones were lying about being cursed. This would suggest that the curse does not always manifest itself in a visible way. Additionally, in the Deathly Hallows, when Ron and Harry use the Imperius Curse on the goblins \\[11\\], the victim does not adopt any physical characteristics that would imply they are bewitched.\n\nBased on this, we can safely assume that people under the influence of the Imperius Curse are not always going to show obvious signs.\n\nBut while I believe Ron bewitched Hermione, I don’t believe Hermione was under the influence the entire time. I believe Ron used the curse a few times in short bursts. Just long enough to start grooming Hermione so that she notices him instead of Harry. I also believe that the kiss Ron and Hermione share during the Deathly Hallows part 2 is not because of the Imperius Curse, but is a direct consequence of Hermione being cursed multiple times.\n\nIf you’re still not convinced, if there’s even a shred of doubt still lingering after considering all of the evidence, then let me leave you with one last thing.\n\nAt the end of the Deathly Hallows pt. 2, when our beloved trio of friends (now adults with children of their own) watch their children ride towards Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express, look at Ron’s expression.\n\n* \\[[49](https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=117)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / In the final scene of the entire film series, Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk their children to platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express. We learn that Ron is now a father of three adorable little Weasley-Granger children. Harry and Hermione warmly smile as they watch their children ride off toward their first Hogwarts adventures but Ron shows no emotion. In fact, he looks a little depressed.\n\nRon. Looks. **Destroyed**. Hermione is smiling. Harry is smiling. But Ron? Ron looks like he dun goofed.

He would be destroyed because even the happy moments wouldn\'t be happy they would just make him feel more guilty, so when everyone is happy at the end this just makes him even more depressed in the false life he has imprisoned himself in.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Link](https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=230)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...As soon as the train pulls away and everyone waves it immediately cuts back to them and you can see Ron look down at his child.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The way he looks down doesn\'t seem to be proud or happy it looks incredibly guilty in my opinion!!\n\nExpertly said, brother SeaWarrior.\n\nIn conclusion… [Ron is a right foul git](https://youtu.be/GCqsItHrwoo), and now **you** know it.\n\n    TLDR Version\n\n**What happened?**\n\nRon Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger to make her fall in love with him, instead of Harry Potter.\n\n**Why would you think that?**\n\nRon treats Hermione very poorly across all the films and Hermione doesn\'t take it well.

Though the films are based on the books, the films are different; changes were made to the original story. The films aren\'t continuing the story of Harry Potter, they are retelling it. Unfortunately, within the film universe\'s retelling, there is plenty of evidence there to suggest Ron used the Imperius Curse on Hermione so that she would fall for him.\n\n    Edit - Additional Evidence (Provided by YOU!)\n\n[u/JohnWickIsMyPatronus](https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnWickIsMyPatronus) writes...\n\n&gt;I happen to be watching Goblet of Fire right now, and I noticed something that also points to Ron being abusive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the ball after Harry introduces Ron to the Patels as their dates, and Mcgonagall says that Harry has to do a customary dance at the beginning of the ball, Ron and one of the Patels start off toward the hall. While walking toward the hall, Patel looks back with a bit of disappointment toward Harry and the other Patel. Ron looks along with her, clearly upset with his robes and jealous of Harry\'s robes. Right after that, he grabs Patel by the arm and forces her to walk toward the hall while muttering ""let\'s go.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It\'s the grabbing of the arm and forcing her somewhere that makes it seem like he\'s comfort doing so, and maybe has done it before. [Looking closer at it,  he clearly gives her a push toward the dance.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;t=1m55s)\n\n\\[[E1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;t=1m55s)\\] This adds supporting evidence to the idea that Ron was becoming increasingly resentful of Harry and also provides additional evidence of Ron\'s controlling (almost possessive) behavior toward women.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[u/bubblegumdog](https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegumdog) writes...\n\n&gt;I always thought the most damning evidence was the final scene in the last film (not including the epilogue) where Hermione comes up to Harry after he breaks the Elder Wand and grabs his hand and just admires him without looking away. Then Ron comes up and she takes his hand as well and then her face completely changes. Shouldn’t she have had the reaction she had with Harry with Ron instead?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One could argue she was proud of Harry at that moment for breaking the wand but it still begs the question: why does Hermione’s face fall when she grabs Ron’s hand?\n\n\\[[E2](https://youtu.be/9LcT9kisys4?t=120)\\] This adds supporting evidence that Hermione is seemingly struggling with her feelings after having been previously cursed. Look closely at Hermione\'s expression as she takes Ron\'s hand. She looks down, suddenly lost in though, then blankly looks forward. It\'s almost as if she\'s waking up and realizing that something isn\'t right. I don\'t believe she is cursed in this scene but it looks like she\'s starting to become aware that her feelings for Ron may not be natural.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'author_fullname': 't2_piswiym', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': '[Harry Potter] [Spoilers] Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger to make her fall in love with him.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/FanTheories', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'FanTheory', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_9zga7v', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.79, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 9718, 'total_awards_received': 7, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'FanTheory', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 9718, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'spoiler', 'edited': 1543007675.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 3, 'gid_2': 1, 'gid_3': 1}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1542938146.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.FanTheories', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: SPOILERS ARE ALL OVER THIS THEORY LIKE DEMENTORS ON AZKABAN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR at the bottom...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay your pitchforks, brothers; lay down your torches, sisters; hold your downvotes Reddites until you consider the following: Ron Weasley isn&amp;#39;t the cute, innocent boy he seems.

I always wondered, where did the connection between them happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But upon watching the films again recently, I noticed something that I hadn&amp;#39;t paid much attention to before. In the Deathly Hallows part 2, Ron Weasley performs the &lt;a href=""http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperius&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;curse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Bogrod, the goblin teller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22""&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 2&lt;/strong&gt; / During the scene where the trio break into Gringotts, Ron Weasley effortlessly uses the Imperius Curse on Bogrod, the goblin teller, without hesitation. Bogrod remains under the effects of the Imperius curse until his own demise at the fiery breath of the security dragon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When cast successfully, the Imperius Curse places the victim completely under the caster’s control (unless the victim is strong enough to resist it) and it is one of three Unforgivable Curses that witches and wizards are forbidden to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why does Ron Weasley know this curse?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought he must have originally learned about it during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson about the Unforgivable Curses in the Goblet of Fire. But when I watched the scene again, I found out that &lt;strong&gt;I was wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron actually already knew about the Imperius Curse prior to Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson, and he learned it from his father, Arthur Weasley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/wsl5fS7KGZc""&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / In the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Mad-Eye Moody provides a lesson about the three Unforgivable Curses, and he calls upon Ron to volunteer the name of one of the curses. Out of all three curses, Ron provides the Imperius Curse and says that he learned it from his father, thus showing he was already familiar with the curse.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads us to our next question. When did Ron practice using the spell to be good enough to charm a goblin teller?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Casting a spell in the wizarding world is not as simple as waving a wand and reading the incantation. If that were true, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wouldn’t be nearly as threatening. As we’ve seen in the films, the ability to successfully perform any spell comes the same way any good skill does – through practice and proper form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M""&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/strong&gt; / The students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, demonstrating that casting magic is not as simple as wand-waving and word-mumbling. Without the proper technique, a spell’s effects can have alternate (disastrous) results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; / Professor Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to mend Harry’s broken arm and fails (further proving that spells are not successful if they are cast by someone who has no idea what they are doing).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q""&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/strong&gt; / Harry trains with Professor Lupin to learn the Patronus Charm, but Harry is not quite able to cast the spell effectively right away. Even Chosen Ones have to practice to &lt;em&gt;git guud&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, &lt;em&gt;“But Harry also&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/F9KyOu_RchU?t=186""&gt;&lt;em&gt;cast the Imperius Curse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;on a goblin and I’m sure he wasn’t running around practicing it on random folks. Maybe it’s just an easier spell to cast?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry has demonstrated (on multiple occasions) a talent for spell mastery due to his unique circumstances. I would argue that part of the reason Harry was able to cast the Imperius Curse so effectively in the Deathly Hallows part 2 without prior training is because he is Voldemort’s Horcrux, and thus, inherits some of the Dark Lord’s abilities (as evidenced through Harry’s ability to speak &lt;a href=""http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue""&gt;parseltongue&lt;/a&gt;). Otherwise, if the curse were really so easy to cast, why wouldn’t anyone just cast it for anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that understanding, we have a reasonable guess as to why Harry can cast the curse so easily, but Ron doesn’t have any ties to the Dark Lord or the ability to master spells easily. Ron has, in fact, been historically slower at learning spells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when (or &lt;strong&gt;on whom&lt;/strong&gt;) did Ron practice the curse to become so effective at it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He practiced it on Hermione Granger, which explains why she suddenly fell in love with him. Think about it. Ron was a jerk to Hermione across multiple films and then suddenly she’s all over him, being giddy around him, staying at his house, and calling him brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What?! No. Ron would never do that. He might have picked on Hermione but that’s not exactly evidence that he would do something so evil as to brainwash a friend.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh ho-ho. Strap in, because there is evidence suggesting Ron is actually a lot darker-minded than we realized. But first, let’s talk about motive. Why would Ron even want to mind-control Hermione?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s because he’s jealous of her affection for Harry and is tired of being in Harry’s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Riddikulus!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not a Boggart; that won’t work on me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But Hermione wasn’t attracted to Harry.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are multiple signs that Hermione might have been initially sweet on Harry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/b6eIgrYraEc?t=175""&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/strong&gt; / After Hermione repairs Harry’s glasses, she recognizes him, even though they had never officially met. Harry’s scar is not visible during this scene, so she would not have recognized him via his scar but of photographs of him. Simple moments of infatuation like this are often the foundation of young crushes that lead to romantic interests.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/DfjM5SUkPPg""&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; / Harry is reunited with Hermione in Diagon Alley while shopping for school supplies, where she ends up repairing his glasses once again and does so with a warm smile and bright eyes. This is much different to how she looks at Ron and may be a sign that some of that early infatuation that she had still lingered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/TJIG-KQPnvg""&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; / When Hermione is cured from the Basilisk’s petrification curse, she crashes into Harry with a big, loving hug first and gives him huge smiles.

While this can be attributed to Hermione feeling bad about Harry&amp;#39;s situation, the way she lingers can also be a sign that she likes him and wished him to be there with her.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/R5xJbQL1eHo?t=154""&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/strong&gt; / During a quidditch match, Harry is attacked by a Dementor and falls unconscious.

When Ron dismisses her offer with a snide remark (such husband material), she turns hopefully to Harry and is elated when he says that he will.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a series of isolated incidents being misinterpreted, either. Even Albus Dumbledore, a powerful wizard with keen intuition and sharp intellect, thought Harry and Hermione might have been together.

If one day, you met a boy who was stupidly famous, obscenely rich, ludicrously successful no matter what he did, and was always the center of everyone’s attention. Then that boy becomes your “best friend”, so that any light of success you have is instantly darkened by his shadow of greatness.

Some of Ron’s older siblings had been on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and it was shown that Ron was hopeful to follow their footsteps.

If you were in Ron’s position, you would definitely notice the blatant favoritism shown to Harry Potter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you’re always in the shadow of your friend’s glory, you start becoming resentful and jealous, which prompts you to do things that make you feel successful (and in control). On a few occasions, Ron sours on Harry for seemingly no rational reason. Other times, Ron purposefully goes out of his way to keep Hermione away from Harry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs""&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / After it is announced Harry Potter will participate in the incredibly dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, Ron becomes upset with Harry. At one point, Ron even quips, &lt;em&gt;“yeah that’s me, Ron Weasley, Harry’s Potter’s stupid friend,”&lt;/em&gt; which shows that he does actually resent being Harry’s friend, deep down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=65""&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / During the attack on the Quidditch World Cup, Ron is seen dragging Hermione away from Harry even though she is calling out for him.

Ron shows no concern for Harry and is quick to pull Hermione away the minute she asks about Harry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry hasn’t always been the nicest friend to Ron, either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/ktfsgXyRbuc?t=38""&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; / Ron attempts to console a brooding Harry and is harshly pushed away. This occurs just moments after Ron nobly defends Harry to a group of troubled Gryffindor members. This may very well have been the moment where Ron realizes that he is worthless.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the most damning evidence of all, the one that shows us the true thoughts that plague Ron Weasley’s mind, is in the Deathly Hallows when Slytherin’s Locket, one of Voldemort’s seven Horcruxes, reveals his darkest fears and anxieties. It reinforces all of the evidence we just reviewed – that Ron feels inferior to Harry, that he feels that his family doesn’t love him, and that he’ll never have a girl like Hermione because of Harry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU""&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / When Harry opens Slytherin’s Locket so that Ron can destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor, the locket speaks to Ron with dark whispers from his own heart. When the locket is first opened it says, &lt;em&gt;“I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.”&lt;/em&gt; Among the truths we learn about Ron through the locket are that:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;o Ron’s mother wanted a daughter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;o Ron’s mother once admitted that she would have preferred Harry as a son.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;o The locket’s shadow of Hermione also said, “Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared to the Chosen One?”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, Slytherin’s Locket could be lying in order to cripple Ron Weasley’s spirit. But also keep this in mind… If all the locket’s words were complete lies, Ron would never have been paralyzed by them. The fact is, there was truth in the locket’s words. The locket only whispered whatever dark thoughts were already in Ron’s heart. This confirms that Ron was indeed jealous of Harry, indeed frustrated about not being able to “get the girl”, and insecure about his relationship with his family. All of this, added with the other evidence, means that it is absolutely plausible that Ron may have been driven to desperation at one point, whether he meant to or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a motive, let’s talk about Ron’s proclivity for dark behavior. Even if we might have a plausible motive, surely our sweet Won-Won would never even think about doing something so vile as to mind-control Hermione. Right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But actually, he’s shown us that maybe he’s not the most noble Gryffindor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ""&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / While eating, Nigel Wolpert delivers a parcel to Ron then awkwardly lingers until Ron dismisses him. When Hermione gives Ron a questioning look, he admits that he promised Nigel Harry’s autograph. Ron basically admitted to securing favors (such as servitude) in exchange for celebrity items, which shows a willingness to use his friendship with Harry to his personal benefit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111""&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / During the scene at the diner where the trio are deciding what to do with the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley is the first one to unflinchingly suggest murder showing that he clearly has a dark side. When Hermione meekly protests, Ron tries to justify his cruelty. Harry has to be the voice of reason by suggesting an alternate, less criminal solution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we have a motive, evidence that Ron had knowledge of the curse to carry out the act, and we have seen evidence of Ron’s darker personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But the Imperius Curse only works on weak-minded wizards. Hermione is definitely not weak. Ron wouldn’t be able to charm someone as strong-willed as her.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sf1dH0Bibyk?t=9""&gt;Right you are, Harry!&lt;/a&gt; The films have demonstrated Hermione to be a strong wizard, amazingly smart and incredibly skilled in a variety of subjects and skillsets. Normally, I would wager that Hermione would be able to resist the Imperius Curse. Except, Hermione is not always strong willed. In fact, when it comes to her friends, we’ve seen her succumb to their requests before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible that, while Hermione would normally be able to resist an Imperius Curse from anyone else, she’s not as strong willed when it comes to her friends. &lt;a href=""https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/""&gt;Stress can also have negative impacts on a person’s mental and emotional willpower&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve seen Hermione go through a lot of emotional distress with her friends throughout the films, from worrying about Harry’s safety to running off crying because of Ron’s cruel comments. The stress Hermione deals with could have also attributed to her not being able to counter the Imperius Curse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Ron took advantage of that fact to &lt;strong&gt;groom&lt;/strong&gt; Hermione and lower her defenses so that he could successfully curse her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming""&gt;Grooming&lt;/a&gt; is a tactic seen in abusive relationships where a person’s normal defenses (or strong wills) are overcome by slowly desensitizing them to abusive behaviors. It often works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0""&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / While Harry is down by the lake with Neville, Hermione approaches Harry with a message from Ron, who is seen standing just a yard behind her. It is clear that Hermione is not thrilled about being used by Ron to deliver a message to a person he is within speaking distance of, but she does so anyway. After failing the first attempt, Hermione attempts to withdraw from the commitment and urges Ron to deliver the message. Ron pushes back and forces Hermione to follow through. Ron&amp;#39;s choice to force Hermione to carry out such an asinine command can be seen as an attempt by him to assert his authority and will over her. This is considered &lt;a href=""https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html""&gt;manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, which is another form of abuse, where the manipulator (Ron) gets the victim to do something they don’t want to do through a variety of techniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137""&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / During the scene at the diner, after Harry makes the decision to wipe the memories of the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley approaches Hermione, caresses her face, then tells her to perform the act of wiping the Death Eater&amp;#39;s memory. This part of a grooming process, where the abuser (Ron) asks their victim (Hermione) to perform various acts that make them feel just as guilty as the abuser. Ron further imposes himself upon Hermione by making physical contact prior to giving a command. Note, that Ron doesn&amp;#39;t ask Hermione to do it. If he truly cared about her, he would realize that wiping someone&amp;#39;s memory might be a sensitive subject considering she just had to wipe her parents&amp;#39; memories. Instead, Ron commands her to do it and Hermione follows through without any protest though it is visibly clear that she is completely uncomfortable with it. This is an example of grooming.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4""&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / While in search of a way to destroy Slytherin’s Locket, the trio take turns carrying the Horcrux. While Ron carries the locket, he starts being overwhelmed by its darkness. Just being near the locket draws out the darkest fears and anxieties of a person. In this case, it happens to be Ron’s jealousy of Hermione. Ron’s jealousy eventually becomes so unbearable that he fights with Harry and then decides to leave. But before doing so, he stops to ask Hermione if she’s staying or going. This is an example of &lt;a href=""https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html""&gt;basic coercive&lt;/a&gt; techniques often used by abusers in relationships where the abuser (Ron) tries to maintain his control by forcing the victim to choose between them or something else. It’s like horrific “all or nothing” scenario where the victim, who clearly has feelings for the abuser, is muddled by the sudden pressure to abruptly make a decision that will have major lasting impacts. Typically, the victim in this situation would surrender to the side of the abuser, because the pressure of making that kind of decision in the moment is too great, and it’s hard for anyone to just walk away. But in this case, we see Hermione actually resist. Interesting how she can do that when she’s not under a mind-controlling curse. It’s clear that Ron’s only method of maintaining relationships is through coercion, manipulation, and mind-control, at this point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron just isn’t an insensitive brat, he’s an abusive friend and a manipulator, as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that Hermione is a victim of abuse and a victim of the Imperius Curse becomes even more clear during the Deathly Hallows, when Ron decides to leave out of jealousy. After Ron leaves, Harry and Hermione instantly start connecting, almost as if Hermione changes without Ron’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/GM5WI4MTXzc""&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / After Ron has left, some time passes, and Harry and Hermione are sitting alone together in their camping tent when they make a sudden connection. As if Hermione is starting to wake up from a nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now we have to determine: When did it all happen? At what point did Ron lose himself and do the unthinkable to Hermione?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering all the evidence, I believe, sometime during the Order of the Phoenix, Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger. This is the time we start seeing Hermione hang around Ron a little more closely but she hasn’t quite started falling over him. That happens during the events of the Half-Blood Prince where Hermione is not only sleeping over at Ron’s house a few days before the start of the school year but she’s also looking at him more and becoming incredibly upset when he runs off with other girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I believe it may have first occurred during the winter break of the school year during Order of the Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/-mJqm_ijE6s?t=25""&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; / Inside the House of Black, the Weasleys celebrate the Christmas holiday with the return of Arthur Weasley (who had been previously attacked) and exchange presents. When Ron opens his present, Hermione smiles warmly at Ron. This is odd because in the previous scene, Hermione is digging at Ron with her usual sharp wit. There is seemingly no reason for her to smile at Ron like that during something as simple as unwrapping a present unless something had happened between them. Maybe they cozied up during the winter break? Or maybe, Ron decided he’d had enough of being the sidekick of the group and used the Imperius Curse on Hermione for the first time. This scene occurs after Harry snaps at Ron, who was only trying to help [39]. Notice, too, in this scene that Hermione does not greet Harry when he arrives. She has typically given Harry big, bright welcomes in the past but here, she only gives him a frowning glance. This could suggest that Ron used the Imperius Curse to also tone-down Hermione’s enthusiasm for Harry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But Hermione doesn’t look like she’s under the influence of the Imperius Curse.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The films have been inconsistent with how the Imperius Curse is represented. For example, in the Goblet of Fire, &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/FyqA7eWrFt8?t=123""&gt;victims of the curse are shown to have milky eyes&lt;/a&gt;. But during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson on the Unforgiveable Curses [12], the Professor says that many wizards and witches claimed they only followed Lord Voldemort because they were under the influence of the Imperius Curse, and implied it was a challenge to determine which ones were lying about being cursed. This would suggest that the curse does not always manifest itself in a visible way. Additionally, in the Deathly Hallows, when Ron and Harry use the Imperius Curse on the goblins [11], the victim does not adopt any physical characteristics that would imply they are bewitched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on this, we can safely assume that people under the influence of the Imperius Curse are not always going to show obvious signs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But while I believe Ron bewitched Hermione, I don’t believe Hermione was under the influence the entire time. I believe Ron used the curse a few times in short bursts. Just long enough to start grooming Hermione so that she notices him instead of Harry. I also believe that the kiss Ron and Hermione share during the Deathly Hallows part 2 is not because of the Imperius Curse, but is a direct consequence of Hermione being cursed multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re still not convinced, if there’s even a shred of doubt still lingering after considering all of the evidence, then let me leave you with one last thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Deathly Hallows pt. 2, when our beloved trio of friends (now adults with children of their own) watch their children ride towards Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express, look at Ron’s expression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=117""&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 2&lt;/strong&gt; / In the final scene of the entire film series, Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk their children to platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express. We learn that Ron is now a father of three adorable little Weasley-Granger children. Harry and Hermione warmly smile as they watch their children ride off toward their first Hogwarts adventures but Ron shows no emotion. In fact, he looks a little depressed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron. Looks. &lt;strong&gt;Destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;. Hermione is smiling. Harry is smiling. But Ron? Ron looks like he dun goofed. He just stares forward with a vacant expression and eyes devoid of any joy. &lt;del&gt;He looks like a man who had a wild fling with a beautiful girl but then got stuck with three children and realized “oh snap, being a parent is hard! I thought this would be different!”&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;If his love for Hermione was genuine, why wouldn’t he be happier in this scene?

Where did he practice it? The films established that spells require practice and proficiency to use them successfully. [&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M""&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q""&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how did Ron become so well practiced with such a spell?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the books...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are separate from the film universe. Though the films are based on the books, the films are different; changes were made to the original story. The films aren&amp;#39;t continuing the story of Harry Potter, they are retelling it. Unfortunately, within the film universe&amp;#39;s retelling, there is plenty of evidence there to suggest Ron used the Imperius Curse on Hermione so that she would fall for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Edit - Additional Evidence (Provided by YOU!)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnWickIsMyPatronus""&gt;u/JohnWickIsMyPatronus&lt;/a&gt; writes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I happen to be watching Goblet of Fire right now, and I noticed something that also points to Ron being abusive.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the ball after Harry introduces Ron to the Patels as their dates, and Mcgonagall says that Harry has to do a customary dance at the beginning of the ball, Ron and one of the Patels start off toward the hall. While walking toward the hall, Patel looks back with a bit of disappointment toward Harry and the other Patel. Ron looks along with her, clearly upset with his robes and jealous of Harry&amp;#39;s robes. Right after that, he grabs Patel by the arm and forces her to walk toward the hall while muttering &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the grabbing of the arm and forcing her somewhere that makes it seem like he&amp;#39;s comfort doing so, and maybe has done it before. &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;amp;t=1m55s""&gt;Looking closer at it,  he clearly gives her a push toward the dance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;amp;t=1m55s""&gt;E1&lt;/a&gt;] This adds supporting evidence to the idea that Ron was becoming increasingly resentful of Harry and also provides additional evidence of Ron&amp;#39;s controlling (almost possessive) behavior toward women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegumdog""&gt;u/bubblegumdog&lt;/a&gt; writes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought the most damning evidence was the final scene in the last film (not including the epilogue) where Hermione comes up to Harry after he breaks the Elder Wand and grabs his hand and just admires him without looking away. Then Ron comes up and she takes his hand as well and then her face completely changes. Shouldn’t she have had the reaction she had with Harry with Ron instead?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One could argue she was proud of Harry at that moment for breaking the wand but it still begs the question: why does Hermione’s face fall when she grabs Ron’s hand?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/9LcT9kisys4?t=120""&gt;E2&lt;/a&gt;] This adds supporting evidence that Hermione is seemingly struggling with her feelings after having been previously cursed. Look closely at Hermione&amp;#39;s expression as she takes Ron&amp;#39;s hand. She looks down, suddenly lost in though, then blankly looks forward. It&amp;#39;s almost as if she&amp;#39;s waking up and realizing that something isn&amp;#39;t right. I don&amp;#39;t believe she is cursed in this scene but it looks like she&amp;#39;s starting to become aware that her feelings for Ron may not be natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count':

It wasn't until this year that I reread it and was like immensely blown away by the sheer amount of information packed in that small book (comparatively speaking to books 4-7.) I find that it was the book that truly laid down the crucial foundation of the whole series. In addition to horcruxes (sp?) we are also introduced to:

-The Vanishing cabinet (instrumental in book 6)***

-The hand of glory (seen again in book 6.) We also get a glimpse at how Burkes knows his dark magic/objects real well. He has perfected his craft to the t. A saviness we see repeatedly displayed in HBP. 


-Elf magic in that it doesn't obey the normal laws of wizard magic i.e. how dobby bewitched platform 9 &amp; 3/4 to be impenetrable, used the hover charm in the muggles' house and bewitched a bludger right in the middle of  hogwarts field ALL without being detected as the source of these oddities by not only the bumbling of a govt body, which is the MoM, but also by intelligent, skilled and astute wizards and witches like Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Madam pomfery (sp?) or Flitwick [assuming all these faculty were within the vicinity of when the bludger was acting up.] Elf magic of course becomes a HUGE plot line in book 6/7 re: RAB, Kreacher's tale.

***EDIT: I want to clarify that I understand CoS offers a whole lot more story than the points I made. But notice I didn't mention major world building or contextual background for the story in my post because I was more impressed by the easter eggs like the Vanishing Cabinet that is so easy to overlook but BAM! huge significance later down the line. Recall that Nearly Headless Nick asked Peeves to throw the Vanishing Cabinet from a high floor in order to distract Filch who was in his office preparing to punish Harry for muddying the hallway after a Quidditch practice. Since then the Cabinet was broken. The twins hid the Slytherin captain who went missing for several months in OotP. That adventure piqued Draco's curiosity and interest in the transitional nature of the device. He later spent months trying to fix it and finally succeeding. This eventually played an important role in Dumbledore's death. 

Like did Harry ever pause and think after Dumby's death, ""Man that was the same cabinet that was once purposefully broken in my cause so that I can skip out a Filch punishment?

&lt;p&gt;-Elf magic in that it doesn&amp;#39;t obey the normal laws of wizard magic i.e. how dobby bewitched platform 9 &amp;amp; 3/4 to be impenetrable, used the hover charm in the muggles&amp;#39; house and bewitched a bludger right in the middle of  hogwarts field ALL without being detected as the source of these oddities by not only the bumbling of a govt body, which is the MoM, but also by intelligent, skilled and astute wizards and witches like Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Madam pomfery (sp?) or Flitwick [assuming all these faculty were within the vicinity of when the bludger was acting up.] Elf magic of course becomes a HUGE plot line in book 6/7 re: RAB, Kreacher&amp;#39;s tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***EDIT: I want to clarify that I understand CoS offers a whole lot more story than the points I made. But notice I didn&amp;#39;t mention major world building or contextual background for the story in my post because I was more impressed by the easter eggs like the Vanishing Cabinet that is so easy to overlook but BAM! huge significance later down the line. Recall that Nearly Headless Nick asked Peeves to throw the Vanishing Cabinet from a high floor in order to distract Filch who was in his office preparing to punish Harry for muddying the hallway after a Quidditch practice. Since then the Cabinet was broken. The twins hid the Slytherin captain who went missing for several months in OotP. That adventure piqued Draco&amp;#39;s curiosity and interest in the transitional nature of the device. He later spent months trying to fix it and finally succeeding. This eventually played an important role in Dumbledore&amp;#39;s death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like did Harry ever pause and think after Dumby&amp;#39;s death, &amp;quot;Man that was the same cabinet that was once purposefully broken in my cause so that I can skip out a Filch punishment? And this git (read: Malfoy) spent a year trying to fix it and smuggle in death eaters&amp;quot;?  #butterflyeffect anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"There’s often discussion in fandom about what houses (other than Gryffindor) the trio could fit in, specifically that they each represent another house. The most straightforward is Hermione in Ravenclaw. Then, due to Harry’s connection with Voldemort (among other things) makes Harry the representative of Slytherin. And Ron is considered the Hufflepuff. 

I understand these arguments, and I think they’re based on actions and abilities, whereas I’m going to base this on motivations.

I find Harry to be more of a Hufflepuff because he cares about all people. He selflessly wants to save the Wizarding World, not for fame but simply to save people. Yes, he feels like it’s his destiny, but he could ignore this if he really didn’t want to. Harry saves Fleur’s sister in the 2nd task, even though he doesn’t know her. He does know this will hurt his chances in winning the Triwizard Tournament. Harry attempts to save Draco, Crabbe, &amp; Goyle from the fiendfyre, his enemies who set the fire to hurt him! 

Ron on the other hand represents Slytherin. Ron is so dedicated and fiercely protective of his family, he’d put his family before anything/anyone else - Slytherins are know for their loyalty. Ron is extremely loyal and usually his disagreements with Harry and Hermione start when he feels they were disloyal towards him.

On a more negative side, Ron can be selfish. In the mirror of Erised he sees himself successful, and better than his family (though not at their expense).

The most straightforward is Hermione in Ravenclaw. Then, due to Harry’s connection with Voldemort (among other things) makes Harry the representative of Slytherin. And Ron is considered the Hufflepuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand these arguments, and I think they’re based on actions and abilities, whereas I’m going to base this on motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find Harry to be more of a Hufflepuff because he cares about all people. He selflessly wants to save the Wizarding World, not for fame but simply to save people. Yes, he feels like it’s his destiny, but he could ignore this if he really didn’t want to. Harry saves Fleur’s sister in the 2nd task, even though he doesn’t know her. He does know this will hurt his chances in winning the Triwizard Tournament. Harry attempts to save Draco, Crabbe, &amp;amp; Goyle from the fiendfyre, his enemies who set the fire to hurt him! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron on the other hand represents Slytherin. Ron is so dedicated and fiercely protective of his family, he’d put his family before anything/anyone else - Slytherins are know for their loyalty. Ron is extremely loyal and usually his disagreements with Harry and Hermione start when he feels they were disloyal towards him. He’s upset that Harry didn’t tell him about the tournament, he thinks it is Harry being disloyal! This is a good quality of Ron’s and represents Slytherin positively. On a more negative side, Ron can be selfish. In the mirror of Erised he sees himself successful, and better than his family (though not at their expense).

,harrypotter,"Hello, this is my first ever post to reddit, I'm not one to ever post online but after discovering this subreddit and finishing the books I felt that I had to post. I apologise if this post is a bit messy, I'm nervous about my first post!  
As the title says I've just finished the Harry Potter series. I grew up with an older sibling that was and still is very fond of Harry Potter, and yet, despite them making me watch the Philosophers Stone over and over again on video until it didn't work anymore, and being lucky enough to be taken to the cinema to watch every film, I never really experienced the Harry Potter series. I did not remember much at all from the films (apart from The Philosophers Stone). I had somehow managed to avoid ever finding out what happens in the books and movies, which is something I am very grateful for.   
I decided to read the books because I was desperate to become immesered in something.  


Anyway, here I am after 2 months! I have read all of the books and watched all of the movies, expect for the Deathly Hallows which I am watching over the weekend.

I apologise if this post is a bit messy, I&amp;#39;m nervous about my first post!&lt;br/&gt;
As the title says I&amp;#39;ve just finished the Harry Potter series. I grew up with an older sibling that was and still is very fond of Harry Potter, and yet, despite them making me watch the Philosophers Stone over and over again on video until it didn&amp;#39;t work anymore, and being lucky enough to be taken to the cinema to watch every film, I never really experienced the Harry Potter series. I did not remember much at all from the films (apart from The Philosophers Stone). I had somehow managed to avoid ever finding out what happens in the books and movies, which is something I am very grateful for.&lt;br/&gt;
I decided to read the books because I was desperate to become immesered in something.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here I am after 2 months! I have read all of the books and watched all of the movies, expect for the Deathly Hallows which I am watching over the weekend. I feel as I assume others also have, very sad! I was, and am still so obssessed with this series and I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do with myself now, this is something that has helped me so much with lockdown depression and I&amp;#39;m not ready to finish it. So my question is: Does anyone have any tips on where to go from here? I know there are other books, which I have now ordered to read.

,harrypotter,"Hey All,

I've always been a massive HP fan and I've just finished the audio books for the 5th time (not sure how I'm going to fall asleep without them until I restart them again) and it always saddens me that we never got an after battle chapter. (not including thr 19years later) 
How the wizarding world mourned and celebrated, Ginny and Harry's reunion,
Ron's reaction to Hermione going back to finish school, 
Harry building his relationship with Kreacher,
What Harry shared with people regarding what they were up to when searching for the horcruxers.

I guess I'm just craving more (hell no to the cursed child), some of my favourite parts of the books are not the twists or the battles. It's the downtime they get living, talking, building friendships and living in the wizarding war. Be nice to hear them talk about the future positively and also deal with the losses.

,harrypotter,"currently reading DH and something i read stuck out to me.

when harry broke the news to ginny that he could no longer be with her bc the danger it posed to her, she did not cry. and harry said that this was one of the many reasons that he fell for ginny. she was hardly teary bc she just...understood. 

book ginny, as ive gathered, is so much more independent, and strong willed than movie ginny.

take slughorns tea party fiasco for instance. ginny was late to the party in the event of her and dean breaking up and she came in crying. harry, the white knight, then stood up from the table so as to draw more attention to himself so no one would see ginny crying.

now as sweet as this may seem it rubs me the wrong way. it gives off the notiom that ginny needed a saviour and that she could not fend for herself. and if you've read the books you'd know that that is not ginny at all!

not only is she a powerful witch and quick on her feet in the face of danger, but she's opinionated and will not allow anyone to walk all over her or tell her what to do. 

*flashback to the scene of her telling ron off for being a git abt her snogging whomever she likes lmao*

as i was saying, having ginny cry over something as stupid as a boy is beneath her and unlike her.

ginny was a badass bitty and i will never forgive the movies for downplaying her character AND her and harrys level of intimacy.

thoughts?

&lt;p&gt;..did nagini like, &amp;quot;Weekend at Bernie&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; Bathilda Bagshot? Was it a giant, mind controlled snake sitting inside a dead woman, making her open locks with a key and climb stairs and stuff? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just no orientation I can think of where the snake could convincingly move a dead body around.  Did Moldy Voldy like, summon the snake out of the body? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because magic and wizards notwithstanding, I&amp;#39;m having a hard time digesting a snake wearing a human suit fooling &amp;quot;the brightest witch of her age&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"I was wondering... 

In Prisoner of Azkaban (somewhere around chapter 20) Remus said that he watched the trio on the Marauder's Map because he assumed they would go to Hargid for Buckbeaks execution.

Later that night when Harry and Hermione used the timeturner to go back, they hid in a broom closet and even hear ther past selfes walking by. They followed them to Hargid and always were quite close by.

So what happened with them on the map? It seems the map couldn't be fooled easily and I think it just would have shown them twice since they were there double at the same time. Didn't Remus wonder about that? He surely would have seen them if he kept such a close eye on them at that time.

PoA is nagini because she is a human who is forced to be a snake which is similar to lupin who the book focuses on as well as the marauded who are aimagi

GoF is the cup because it partiall focuses on Cedric a hufflepuff also a goblet is similar to a cup and there is the Triwizard cup

OotP is the diadem because we see a lot of cho and Luna both raven laws and Da meetings take place in the room of requirement where the diadem is hidden

HBP is the ring because we learn a lot about the Gaunts who the ring originally belonged to and dumbledore putting the ring on is integral to the plot and his death.

DH Is the locket because this is the book where we find it destroy it and it fucks up there time in the forest. And the locked was used on some special editions for the book.

,harrypotter,"Something that is never really explained is the rationale and history of the anti-muggle/muggle-born ideology held by people such as the Malfoy’s and other death eaters.

The first, obvious explanation is that it’s simply a stand-in for racism and other forms of bigotry and discrimination and therefore Voldemort is Hitler and the whole thing is a sort of metaphor for real history. 

That explanation works up to a point but the history of the Wizarding World and its relations with muggles reveals a more complicated picture. As far as we know  the existence of wizards is hidden from the muggles because witches and wizards were persecuted in previous centuries. This fact provides part of the explanation for these attitudes - they are motivated by resentment and fear of their historical persecutors - but there are other things to consider. 

It is striking how powerful witches and wizards are by the time the story is set. People like Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape etc are easily powerful enough to allow the wizarding world to live without fear of abuse by muggles. This must mean that in the time since the wizarding world went underground magic has become more potent and wizards have become more powerful. 

My theory is that contact with muggles diminishes the power of witches and wizards. The fear of death eaters is that by admitting muggle-borns into Hogwarts and Wizarding World their great magic-based civilisation built over the last few centuries could disappear and they would return to the days of their persecution and weaker magic.

EDIT: If you have a reason why you don’t think this is true I’d love to hear it and discuss it but if it starts with ‘maybe’ I don’t wanna know. I’m talking about what’s literally on the pages. 

Bathilda Bagshot was a Grindelwald supporter; Why else would she have his photograph framed and on display in her home fifty years after his defeat? That should have been gone before Fantastic Beasts in the 1920s, but it’s still there on Christmas Eve 1997, when Harry is in her house. This is a man who slaughtered thousands of people, a man who’s existence in history is treated much the same as Hitler’s. Aka, we all know he’s irredeemably bad, anyone who says otherwise is a big red flag.

Bathilda took him in for the summer after he was EXPELLED FROM DURMSTRANG. She most likely didn’t know the details but would surely come to the same conclusion as the reader does - what messed up thing do you have to do to get expelled from the school that literally teaches the dark arts? She states that he was a charming boy ‘whatever he became later’. That’s a pretty dismissive way to talk about this universe’s Hitler fifty years later. There’s no ‘whatever’ about genocide. 
She notes on how Grindelwald and Dumbledore were very close. (😉) she shows Rita Skeeter a letter from Dumbledore to Grindelwald, that clearly states they want to subjugate the muggles ‘for the greater good’. Grindelwald was not keeping his plans a secret from aunt Bathilda. She knew what he wanted, and then he went out and did it. 
She then says Grindelwald skipped town the day after Ariana died. That could be a coincidence... Except that suddenly Grindelwald and Dumbledore weren’t pals anymore. Dumbledore’s defeat of Grindelwald was a hugely famous historical event. And as a matter of fact, Bathilda’s magnum opus ‘A History of Magic’ was published just two years after Grindelwald was defeated, in 1947.

TLDR; Bathilda took in her nephew for three months who she knew was a violent criminal. He SPOKE OPENLY IN FRONT OF HER OF HIS PLANS TO COMMIT A GENOCIDE, killed a child, left her care, spent forty years committing that genocide very famously and publicly, and got defeated by the brother of the child he killed. Bathilda’s response to this is to keep his photograph framed and on display in her home, and call the bloodshed he caused ‘whatever’, and focus more on how charming he was.

,harrypotter,"I was watching Goblet of Fire last night, and after Draco gets turned into a ferret by Moody, he runs around the tree and says, 'My Father will hear about this!' (Draco's iconic line as always)

So, that got me thinking - I'd really like to know how exactly Lucius heard about it and what Draco said. This is how I imagine it went:

\-

Draco: Dad, that idiot Mad-eye did something today.

Lucius: \*sighs in annoyance\* What is it, Draco?

Draco: Well... I was telling Potter about our bet on the tournaments, and Moody came round and he... he turned me into a... a ferret.

Lucius: \*Turns to Draco and laughs\* What?

Draco: Yes... Couldn't you get him sacked or... or something?

Lucius: \*Laughs\* Draco I hear about your little stories from Hogwarts almost every day. I would hope you understand you must stick up for yourself sometimes, son.

Draco: But he simply can't work at the school, he turned–

Lucius: That's quite enough, Draco. Come to me when you have a genuinely interesting story to tell. But until then, you can keep the childish goings-on of school to yourself. Honestly, you're in fourth year.

,harrypotter,"Tldr: If you went to Hogwarts, what experiences would you want? What would excite you about magic? What drama would you want?

So, I'm looking to run a game of Harry Potter RPG, set in the late 1800's before the time of Grindlewald and the First World War.

I have some ideas on what I want to do, for instance, showing how the attitude towards muggles (currently going through the industrial revolution etc) is changing rapidly and how this leads to Grindlewalds war. If the game goes well, I'll probably have a 'darker' campaign where they play in the First Wizarding World War as adults, using some choice parts of FBAWTFT.

However, the game I will run will focus on years 2-7 (already ran the first year!) through Hogwarts, just regular magical children trying to get through school and find their place in world's both mundane and magical.

You see how our hero is flawed, and throughout the book, instead of focusing on Dumbledore's mission, he spends most of the year obsessing about his sworn rival Malfoy, and lets personal feelings get in the way of his duty. This all comes to a head in the scene in the bathroom, when Malfoy is crying. All of a sudden, there is a role reversal. Harry was always the underdog, the kid being bullied or standing up for the bullied, and Malfoy was nothing but an arrogant brat. Now we see Malfoy as a kid who is stuck in an impossible situation, having been tasked by the Dark Lord with killing his headmaster, a man he may not love the way Harry does, but who has nevertheless been an authority figure throughout his childhood, and despite his family's dislike of Dumbledore, for Draco it is probably impossible to imagine a world without him, being such a huge part of Hogwarts, the school which is, as it is a boarding school, a second home of sorts for all its students (although for Harry it probably feels like his first real home). In the process of trying to get to Dumbledore (in very indirect ways), Malfoy also ends up hurting other students, which must also have taken a toll on him. When Harry walks in on Malfoy in the bathroom, we realize that now it is Malfoy that is the underdog, the kid whose father has been shown to be much less powerful than he first appeared, and whose family is under the thumb of the Dark Lord, and Draco is caught between a rock and a hard place. Harry, on the other hand, is the kid whose hatred of Malfoy has blinded him to the point where all he cares about is getting him, and he is unable to see that Draco might actually be in a difficult position. His hatred of Malfoy blinds him from having empathy for him, despite the fact that he notices that Malfoy has been looking pale and distraught throughout the school year. When he releases the Sectumsempra spell, he almost unwittingly murders Draco, after having humiliated him by walking in on him whilst he was crying. In the movie, however, when he sees Malfoy crying, he simply starts yelling at him, which implies to the audience that his indignation is righteous. Also in the film, after using the Sectumsempra spell, he doesn't get punished (after almost killing another student), but instead gets taken into the Room of Requirement by his friend's sister to hide the book and get a kiss. It is implied that it is mostly the book that's evil, and not Harry that is in the wrong for using a spell he didn't know (labelled ""For Enemies"") from a book he found, although he should clearly have known better.

,harrypotter,"So I was discussing this the other day with my friend, and I was wondering: if given the chance, what's the one thing you would change in the Harry Potter series. 

It can be a small thing, like clothes, or as major as undoing a character's death. You can be as specific or superficial as you want, but it can only be one thing. I'd also love to know why and how that would change the series in your opinion!

For me it would have to be keeping Sirius alive! I'd love to keep everyone alive, but I would love to see Sirius bonding with Harry, his dead best friend's son, after so much trauma.

&lt;p&gt;It can be a small thing, like clothes, or as major as undoing a character&amp;#39;s death. You can be as specific or superficial as you want, but it can only be one thing. I&amp;#39;d also love to know why and how that would change the series in your opinion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it would have to be keeping Sirius alive! I&amp;#39;d love to keep everyone alive, but I would love to see Sirius bonding with Harry, his dead best friend&amp;#39;s son, after so much trauma. Telling stories about James, Lily and Remus of course! Helping each other through the hardest times and Harry and Sirius finally having someone they could always rely on, grieving together and just going about life with each other!&lt;/p&gt;

She'd get way too distracted and couldn't actually follow the story and would interrupt every other word. So eventually we transitioned into us trading off every other page in books at her reading level so she could practice but not feel like she had to do EVERYTHING.

A few weeks ago when she was here, she asked if I would read to her while she was in the shower (which I tried doing a year ago because I thought it might be less distracting). I decided, ""Eh, fuck it. Let's see how this goes.""

I read two whole chapters of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe to her, and she only interrupted once to ask what a word meant. It was incredible.

Tonight I decided to see if we could continue the book. She was able to tell me the general gist of what happened in the two chapters up to that point, and when we were done with the third chapter, she could tell me 95% of what happened. And then we practiced making predictions about what we think is going to happen in the next chapter.

,harrypotter,"In my opinion, JKR didn't look very far in the immigration issue when she wrote her book. Having gone through the hoops of the Australian Department of Border Protection (or whatever it's called nowadays), let me tell you: the days where you could just go on holidays and decided to stay are long gone.
There is Paper Work, More Paperwork, and Long Waiting Times. 

First issue: the change of name: magic works on people and things, but not on electrical items, even back in the days, everything was getting computerised:  passport, birth certificate, police records, bank account, tax details, pensions. The ""Wendells"" might have thought that was their name, but they would have run in trouble the moment they wanted to prove their ID to the Australian government.

Now even imagining that Hermione's spell would have changed their ID in a way that doesn't look suspicious there is still the issue of getting a visa, they would have either needed a sponsorship for a job, or to set up their own business. In both case it would have taken a few months to organise: either finding a job and getting the visa approved, or setting up a business plan and finding the finances and  getting a visa approved.

And lastly, Hermione's parents seem, at least middle class, from which we can imagine that the would have brought their house, and probably have their own dental practice too. Once again, it would have taken a few months to sell the house and sell the business (because moving country is expensive, they couldn't just go cheap and leave everything behind).

I'm guessing it would have taken at the very least 3 months before the leave the UK, but with a more realistic 6 months timeframe. Maybe even more, as given Hermione's personality, we can guess that they would have been the kind of people to be organised and careful in their preparations. By that time, either the Death Eaters have already paid them a visit and they would probably be dead, or they'd be boarding the plane just as the WW is finishing, rendering the whole ordeal pointless.

I was on the internet when i saw this scene i had never seen extended or deleted.
Anyway in the final movie of the harry potter theres a scene where hagrid is holding a (faking) dead harry potter and voldermort tells everyone he is dead and who will join the death eaters now before this all the Slytherin members (not including draco) were locked in my gous is so they could be written out of the story line and for draco to hesitantly join with encouragement from this parents and aunt with him also having the most awkward hug ive ever seen between draco and voldermort. Now after this Neville gives this meaning full speech and for harry to roll out of hagrids arms and reveal hes alive and fight back. 
Know in the deleted scene draco throws harry his wand when its revealed hes alive.
know im not saying dracos an angel in fact he's pretty far from it but in my opinion i don't think that scene should be cut. One name that ive heard going around for draco is the boy who didn't have a choice and after dumbeldores death,that awkward moment with voldermort and encouragement from his family i just feel like even though everything it should have stayed in the movie.
plus i remember this end scene from the movie where we see them as adults with there own kids and harry and draco just had this moment that makes it feel like the scene should have stayed in.
Now thats just my opinion but id love to know what other wizards /muggles think to you agree/disagree and why?

,harrypotter,"Some intresting Facts related to him :

* Lyall and Hope , Remus parents had met due to a Boggart
* Remus Lupin was Intended Target of Fenrir Greyback because Lyall had insulted Greyback
* Albus Dumbledore himself had arrived at the Lupin's Doorstep to invite Remus to Hogwarts
* He was awarded Order of Merlin , First Class

I have seen many people say that Relationship between Tonks and Remus was out of nowhere and Tonks Forced Lupin .

Actually it wasnt a Out of Nowhere one . In books it couldnt be explained since Story was From harry's perspective but Later on in Remus Lupin's Biography which was published on Pottermore its very well explained .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*As Lord Voldemort once again gained ascendancy, the old resistance regrouped and Remus found himself once more part of the Order of the Phoenix.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*This time, the group included an Auror who had been too young to belong to the Order during its first incarnation. Clever, brave and funny, pink-haired Nymphadora Tonks was a protégée of Alastor ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody, the toughest and most grizzled Auror of them all.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Remus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the young witch. He had never fallen in love before. If it had happened in peacetime, Remus would have simply taken himself off to a new place and a new job, so that he did not have to endure the pain of watching Tonks fall in love with a handsome, young wizard in the Auror office, which was what he expected to happen. However, this was war; they were both needed in the Order of the Phoenix, and nobody knew what the next day would bring. Remus felt justified in remaining exactly where he was, keeping his feelings to himself but secretly rejoicing every time somebody paired him with Tonks on some overnight mission.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater’s house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He’s still handsome, isn’t he, even after Azkaban?’). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.’). At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You’d know perfectly well who I’ve fallen for, if you weren’t too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.’*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Remus’s immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. He therefore pretended not to understand Tonks, which did not fool her at all. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility. However, he avoided any further excursions with her, barely talked to her, and started volunteering for the most dangerous missions. Tonks became desperately unhappy, convinced not only that the man she loved would never willingly spend time with her again, but also that he might walk to his death rather than admit his feelings.*

,harrypotter,"Hello everyone!

This is my first post and I’m at the mercy of Reddit but I need help with an engagement proposal. This is to all magical fans of the HP community. We are both located in PHX Arizona at the moment so physically scouting locations and meeting with people will be difficult. Luckily I have some amazing friends with 360 cameras willing to go to any parks to check them out for me.

I am here on reddit looking for insight into all the HP books, movies and lore to assist with this. We are both Ravenclaw so there is that. I am looking into Snowy Owls and Ravens in the DFW area. If you know of anything that would help make this day more magical feel free to drop comments or DM. If you know someone with special talents in the areas listed below, drop their contact info. 

I will be proposing this July in Dallas TX and I’m looking for some ideas to help make it so magical. I will compensate anyone who assists with this. $$$

Here is a list of what has been floating around my head and what is still missing.

Covered: The ring, I will post pictures of this epic ring later. I promise it’s worth the wait. :)

Needed:

Location: A very magical park in DFW (outdoors because Covid sucks).  
\*No to the Dallas arboretum because my sister's fiance JUST proposed there and I don’t want to copy them.

Cloaks: Family and friends will be waiting for the special moment dressed in cloaks. 

Music: Looking for a small 4 piece quartet of some sort that could play a couple of songs or a local high school band for hire.

Special Effects: Currently looking for any pyrotechs or special effects artists in DFW to assist with little magical effects.

Video/Photographer: Need a Photographer that can do Light writing and a videographer to capture the moment.

Possible scavenger hunt?

I’m reaching out to some Game masters for Escape rooms who may be able to help design a fun scavenger hunt. 

Let me know of any magical extras you may think of that would be perfect for this proposal.

,harrypotter,"...which is how he failed.

Which was the point of the books, that love is the most powerful thing in JK Rowling's view.

From the fact that Voldemort couldn't kill a baby because of love.

To the fact Bellatrix was in love with Voldemort and he neglected/overlooked her as insignificant.

To the fact that his ""most loyal servant"" loved the mother he murdered.

JK Rowling was trying to show that Snape LOVED Lily even after she died. And that is the point of why Voldemort failed.

Because of genuine, bona fide love. Love does not always motivate us to make the right choices. If it did, what a boring, easy, dare I say heavenly world it'd be? It'd be perfection. You meet someone, fall in genuine love, and that's it. Happily ever after. Case dismissed.

That is hardly most people's stories. Humans make the wrong choices. We lose people we genuinely care for. And sometimes maybe we do everything right and still lose them.

But if you think people are never genuinely in love (sometimes they aren't), you're missing the point JK Rowling was trying to show.

That even if you make the wrong choices, even if you lose someone you genuinely care for, even if it's your fault they died in the first place, they can be the one warm part in your heart.

Anyone whose child has died can attest to this: It's not obsession when someone you genuinely love died. Anyone who lost a beloved (nonabusive) spouse can also say such. They still feel his arms around them. REAL love never dies.

Even if Snape never kissed Lily, she was the brightest place in his dark heart. JK Rowling wanted the readers to know he loved her.

I for one think it's tragically beautiful when you love someone unconditionally. Most people don't. They only love someone as long as they're in their face.

Snape carried Lily around in his heart even though she married his bully, the person he hated the most. He loved her even though she never had any idea how he felt about her. Even though they never went on a date or shared a snog.

,harrypotter,"I learnt today that there was a real life Doris Crockford who wrote a story about a train, published in 1937.

The train, The Flying Scotsman, is based on a real life train (said to be the inspiration for the Hogwarts Express)

Every day the train would leave from platform 10, King’s Cross Station

And in Doris’s book the train goes on a magical adventure

(Remember the witch Harry meets in the Leaky Cauldron Book 1 who keeps going back to shake his hand? Her name? Doris Crockford)

,harrypotter,"\*Probably a few do but most had their looks changed\*

I was thinking about the Snape doesn't look like THIS, he looks like THIS thread while reading the first book, and..

Vernon is swapped with Petunia/Dudley in the films. In the books, Vernon is dark haired, the other two blonde. In the movies, it's the reverse.

Hagrid's description: A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

In the books, you can't see anything but his eyes of his face (at least at first). In the movies, you can actually see his face.

Hermione doesn't have buck teeth in the films.

Dumbledore doesn't look weak in the books. (This could've been solved by making a younger actor look old though).

Gilderoy Lockhart is suchahunk Ginny has a crush on him in the book. In the movies, he might be kinda handsome but he's certainly not THAT good-looking.

Umbridge in the book looks like a toad.

Cedric Diggory is supremely handsome in the books. (Sorry, Robert Pattinson, you've been cast as two super attractive dudes but neither time does your face actually look super hot).

Fleur in the books...looks like the human version of a cupcake. Super sweet. Tantalizing. There's even a drawing of her in the fourth book (and, spoiler alert, looks nothing like the actress).

That's NOT how I picture Tonks. Sorry, but...I like my version better (at the movies).

Bellatrix is not hot in the books. She looks tired and from her description, I gather she's rather plain looking but very bold. I LOVE Helena portraying her, but if we're getting technical, that's not how Bellatrix looks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Far as I'm concerned, Draco, Harry, Ron, Luna, McGonagall, Arthur, and Molly probably all do look like they should.

Anyway, I feel all these actors did a splendid job even if their LOOKS didn't match their descriptions via book, their personalities are what matters.

,harrypotter,"Beware, this is silly. But still, here it goes.

Tonks just arrived at the Burrow with Ron, after the mid-air encounter with death eaters. Remus asks what took them so long, and she answers:

""“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she triedvery  hard  to  kill  me.  I  just  wish  I’d  got  her,  I  owe  Bellatrix.  But  we  definitely  injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she wasfussing over us —”

And then, this is Remus' reaction: 

""*A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.*""

So, Lupin is tense. Definitely feeling... I'd say some supressed anger, mixed with relief. But, ""not being able to say anything else"" also speaks of pain. And emotion. As if everything that *could be said* would be emotionally unbearable. As if the pain'd be too much to handle.

I don't think I ever noticed that line. Maybe because I thought of his reaction as mainly preocupation and angst directed at Tonks, for being vulnerable to Bellatrix. And that's still what I think it is, but at the same time, Bellatrix killed Sirius. It definitely isn't a name without meaning to Remus: it has certain weight in his life, in his present. And, well, I'm a Wolfstar shipper since I first read PoA, but even if I wasn't, *Bellatrix killed Sirius*. His, at the very least, *only living friend*. And now, she tried to kill his *wife**.* 

So I don't think it's only fear of losing Tonks what Remus is feeling. He's thinking of Sirius, as well. Fear of losing her, in exactly the same way he lost  Sirius.

,harrypotter,"Hello All,  

I saw a post here yesterday about the classic ""Albus Severus"" line, and some more Snape-hate to go along with it. Whilst I agree the poor child has been given a horrible name, i just wanted to draw attention to Snape's role in this whole thing.  

I think Harry looks back at defeating Voldemort, which is probably the most important thing any wizard ever did, and realises three main components responsible are Himself, Dumbledore and Snape.  

Everyone is aware of the role of the first two, but people forget that Snape's role included being a high risk double agent, spending time with Voldemort (who killed Lily, that must have been tough), and maintaining this role even after his mentor/guide had passed.  

Not only did he conspire to kill Dumbledore and become part of his final plan, he also faked the sword, and presented the real one to the trio, exactly as instructed. He then desperately tryed to track down Harry at the last moment, to the point where he was killed by Voldemort. However, he still managed to pass on the critical information to Harry.  

I think it's easy to think of The Prince's Tale just being some soppy redemption of Snape due to his love for Lily, but the purpose of that chapter (and the purpose of Snape telling Harry), is to get the information to him that he has the Horcrux within himself, and he must sacrifice himself at the last moment.  

I only really appreciated this last night while listening. Snape was a very important piece of that final plan, allowing Dumbledore's plan to continue beyond his death, and using Snape's unique position in the game. Without Snape, it doesn't work out. Just something to consider.

,harrypotter," 

Hey everyone! Today I want to talk about wand cores and why I think that Garrick Ollivander's wands are NOT the absolute best and why I feel the characters in Harry Potter only believe so out of bias. And that's where I'm going to start:

Garrick Ollivander is the best wandmaker in the UK, however that does NOT mean he's the best in the world. Why does everyone say he is? Out of cultural bias of course, his family name is famous in the UK and Ireland and he's credited with the creation of the term ""Supreme Wand Cores"", being Dragon heartstring, Unicorn hair and Phoenix feather, which makes him standout from among his fellow wandmakers in the UK, however we see first hand that Viktor Krum when he says: ""I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch wand. They are the best although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander."", this shows that Krum, and likely other people in Eastern Europe feel that Gregorovitch's wands are the best in the world, and I'd bet money that American wizards and witches would say the same about American wandmakers and so on. So why do all the characters we love in Harry Potter say Ollivander is the best? Out of cultural bias, pure and simple. 

Now, I want to address Garrick's ""Supreme Wand Cores"" and why I feel they aren't truly the best or strongest cores. I think he chose these three because they were the most balanced, and would therefor cause the least dissatisfied customers. I feel he chose this method because it was best for business, if the wands are easily tamed, less wizards and witches would come back to his shop with complaints, and thus his reputation would remain in good standing. While this makes sense and IS good business practice, I want to examine a few wands with cores we know to be at least as good as the ""Supreme Cores"", and in many cases, vastly superior. 

\#1: The Elder Wand, this wand has a Thestral tail hair core and as we know, is the most powerful wand in existence. While the rumors of it being made by Death are cute, it's MUCH more likely to have been made by  Antioch Peverell and the power it possesses would seem to indicate that Thestral tail hairs are much more powerful than the ""Three Supreme Cores"". 

\#2: Salazar Slytherin's Wand, this wand had a Basilisk horn core and was crafted by Salazar himself, it was stated by Gormlaith Gaunt, a former wielder of the wand, to have been more powerful than the one she got from Ollivander's which had a Dragon heartstring core. Additionally, this wand could be instructed to ""sleep"" when spoken too in Parseltongue, giving this core strategic advantages to those who could speak it. 

\#3: Fleur Delacour's Wand, this wand had a Veela hair core and was crafted by a French wandmaker, likely for Fleur specifically as the hair came from her grandmother, the use of this core shocked Garrick when examining the wand, who believes that Veela hair wands are too temperamental. We know Fleur is a capable witch and has performed impressive feats of magic with this wand, comparable to anything done with Garrick's own ""Supreme Core"" wands, showing it's at least equal. 

\#4: Webster &amp; Chadwick Boot's Wands, these wands had Horned Serpent horn cores and were stated by Isolt Sayre, who wielded Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk wand, to have been of exceptional power. Chadwick was able to use his wand to duel against Gormlaith Gaunt who was much more powerful than he was and far more experienced to a draw, forcing Gormlaith to complement his power. This is a true testament to the wand's core, which was amplified 10x when used with Webster's wand, which was it's twin. Like the Basilisk core wands, these wands could be spoken too in Parseltongue, instead alerted their owners when they were in danger when they heard the ancient language. 

\#5: Seraphina Picquery's Wand, this wand was crafted by Violetta Beauvais, an American wandmaker, it had a Rougarou hair core. While we haven't seen this wand in action, we know it belonged to the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, and it's unlikely she'd be capable of achieving the power necessary for this position with a wand of low quality. Implying this wand is very powerful, again being at LEAST on par with anything from Garrick. 

Looking at all this info, it would seem safe to believe that the power of a wand core comes directly from how powerful the creature it was taken from, a belief that is further backed up by Garrick's comments on weak cores such as Troll whiskers and Kneazle hair. Since Thunderbirds are relatives to the Phoenix, and equally powerful in their own way, we can assume Thunderbird tail feather cores would be comparably powerful. Nundu mane quills would also likely produce massively powerful wands, since they're said to be even more dangerous than Dragons.

,harrypotter,"In PoA, it’s mentioned that the last part of the DADA final involved facing a Boggart and fending it off by performing the Riddikulus Charm. When Hermione tried to face the Boggart, she ended up running away and crying bc she couldn’t stand up to it and found the fear overwhelming (the Boggart had taken the form of McGonagall telling her that she failed everything) and since the narration doesn’t mention anyone having any similar reactions, it can be assumed that Hermione was the only one not to tackle the Boggart successfully.

,harrypotter,"Voldemort, to me, and I'm sure it was the intent, is the equivalent of Wizard Hitler. Hitler, for all his evil, was incredibly charming, for those of his times, he was likable, even. Before the War, and before the  the Genocides became public, he was even Time's Man of the Year. He was celebrated even in America, by non-Nazis, as Germany's potential hero, who would raise her to greatness again. As we saw, he brought her to utter degradation, degeneracy and ruin. Yet, he was compelling. He spoke eloquently, in a manner that many real life people felt themselves almost bewitched by his speech.  


I say all these things because if you examine how a man as morally repulsive as Hitler could gain so many followers, you can see the qualities necessary for a Wizard like Voldemort to gain so many followers as well. Voldemort, when I read him, is highly intelligent, cold, calculating, menacing, charismatic...Yet as utterly inhuman as any serial killer in any prison. Lacking in feeling, which only added to his menace; we are dealing with someone amazing, who has transcended humanity in both mentality and form - and yet in the process has become grotesque. Someone who could've been truly GREAT - Among the greatest of all time, as Hitler, had he been a good man, could've been one of the great men of history. There is a nuance to Voldemort that makes it plain why one would follow him, if they agreed with his views. 

Movie Voldemort on the other hand comes off a clown. A cartoon villain. A cackling, goofy sort of maniacal metaphorical mustache twirling madman.

I can't see Snape doing so in his youth either.

Voldemort to me is Dumbledore's dark double - For as noble and as great as Dumbledore is, Voldemort is the ugliest personification of what Dumbledore would be if he dabbled in evil - and should as such carry the same grace, just darkened; the same nobility, just without any warmth; the same eloquence, just without any humanity.

there's my other reviews for the other movies if you're interested back to the movie

&amp;#x200B;

1. **HARRY AND THE DURSLEYS**

The dursleys are horrible we can all agree on that right? I am mainly going to focus on Dudley so our movie starts off fucking horrible. In the books it was harry making fun of Dudley which felt amazing but in the movie for some reason its Dudley and his gang making fun of harry honestly its so dumb why they even cut this out. Harry was tormented by Dudley for like 10 years of his childhood and to have him finally truly stand up to him is such an amazing moment for harry. The movies have this weird obsession of ruining ever character for some reason and harry is ruined hard in this movie. Then we the dementors show up and this annoys me so much, the fact that harry's patronus is not even a fucking stag omfg the movie just started and it already failed this bad. And they forget to say who sent the dementors and cut out the owls being sent which was hilarious in the books. Bad start movie, bad start

2. **NUMBER 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE**

Weirdly enough this is like the 3rd house we see in the entire series. Anyway Grimmauld place is probably one of the best locations in the place because we practically spend so little time their and already know so much about the place, like everyone can remember Mrs Black's screaming portrait or the troll leg umbrella stand that Tonks keeps knocking... oh wait all of this stuff I mentioned is cut out from the film. And who can forget the cleaning, only a series like Harry Potter can make fucking cleaning fun as hell and I can't believe they cut that out too honestly whats wrong with this movie. Now probably my favourite thing that happens in this place is that amazing incredible boggart scene with Molly and harry see's all her children dead and not just her children even a dead harry. That is fucking beautiful and it basically solidifies that harry is an unofficial Weasley and its done in such an amazing way by not just saying that he's one but showing it in a heartbreaking way and I love it for doing that and I hate that they cut this out. They also forgot Ron and Hermione being prefects.

**3. THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC**

I love the fact that this is the first time we actually see the ministry and it makes for an awesome reveal. I don't really get that sense of awe and spectacle in the film mainly due to the fact we don't see all of floors. Like I said with grimmauld place we practically live at the ministry its described so well in the books that it just sticks with you like I can name you like 4 floors at the top of my head rn. But before since I watched the movies first I never really cared about the ministry that much at all and its just skimmed over. We just see the atrium and then BOOM we're already at the hearing but in the books we see so many floors and places that I can't help but love it. Now the actual hearing, the fact this entire hearing was done bcz harry did magic outside of school is lost once you realised that in the movies they do magic outside of school so many times and it just seems comical in the books they bring up the fact that harry ''did'' magic in the chamber of secrets but he says it was dobby and fudge doesn't believe none of it. And Dumbledore ignoring isn't really shown that much yk in the books its made apparent that the entire time Dumbledore didn't even look at him or show any sign that he knew harry even existed but in the movie he just kinda shouts his name quietly and then he just doesn't care afterwards, which is stupid af.

**4. PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE**

Umbridge is horrible, we can all agree on that... BUT, in the movies her actions don't really seem that bad beside the fact that she carved words on harry's hand which is horrible but compared to her actions in the books she's pretty tame actually. She doesn't ban him from quidditch, she doesn't give him multiple detentions, she doesn't put Hagrid on probation and doesn't ban harry from hogsmeade. In the books harry wanted to basically leave Hogwarts, she makes his life hell at Hogwarts. And her appearance is not even close to how she was described in the books. I once showed a picture of how umbridge looked like in the books in a discord chat and everyone was fucking disgusted and I don't think people were disgusted when they saw how she was in the movie no offence to actor she played her fine but its mainly the fact that she's not as despicable as she was in the books. Oh yeah and the quibbler thing with was amazing and I hate the they cut it out and where's Firenze that was funny, the fact that Dumbledore hired a teacher just to annoy umbridge is incredible.

**5. DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY**

The fact that a huge part of this book was just butchered down into into a montage and half a class is horrible. This shit was fun as hell in the books, seeing the kids rebelling against umbridge and the entire ministry is amazing I loved it so much. And neville finding the room of requirement by accident is fucking dumb af and how does Hermione even know about the room in the first place? you siriusly telling me that Hermione knows what this room does and doesn't know where its at, EVEN THOUGH DUMBLEDORE TOLD HARRY LAST YEAR bruh just bruh. Where the coins at? those shit were the best and its used in the later books, Draco using it in book 6 and neville using it to call people in the battle of Hogwarts and its like why cut this out the books came out before the movie came out so its even more stupider. And Dobby, thats all I have to say,

**6. St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries**

*Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.*

*“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .”*

*But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.*

*“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery*

*voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, “Thanks Mum.”*

*His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any- thing less funny in his life.*

Thats all I have to say, They cut out this incredible scene and I will never forgive them for cutting this out.

**7. Snape's Worst Memory**

Damn what an amazning chapter. Occulmency is so much fun like reading I fucking love it so much, its like watching a film reel I in a book, but in the movies it just happens so quickly and fast and they just use it as an excuse to reuse old footage from the other movies for nostalgic purposes, and thats annoying in the books we mostly see stuff we never knew before. Snape in the books was cruel in these lessons and not encouraging enough but in the movies he doesn't really do much. For example when harry see's his memory, in the books he throws a jar of dead crockroaches, in the movie Snape just tells him to get out. Now the actual scene in fucking stupid in the movies, thats not even what protego does and the pensive isn't even fucking there, its so fascinating to see what Hogwarts was like back then and see what the marauders were like but in the film we just see them hanging Snape and thats it. There's a deleted scene not really scene, which shows lily with them but for some reason they cut it out. They forget the most important part, there's a reason this is called Snape's worst memory he called his best friend a mud blood and regretted his entire life. 

**8. O.W.L.s**

Oh my god. The movie mentions this and tell us how important this is, AND THE DON'T EVEN SHOW IT.  Even in the HBP movie mcgonnagoll mentions that harry wants to become an auror BUT HE NEVER EVEN HAD HIS CARRER ADVICE WTF. And now the actual exams, only a series like Harry Potter could make exams fun. Its weird to say but I love reading the exams and all the kids being stressed and its so fascinating to see how wizards do their exams, But the movies just doesn't really care about Hogwarts being a school. Look how many classes are in these movies, Barely any. And where tf is Hagrid hulk smashing umbridge and her ministry cronies? that shit was phenomenal I loved that so much and then mcgonnagoll gets four stunning spells to the chest, and they cut it all out. Istg this movie is falling apart, OOTP isn't even my favourite book in the series, but it has some of the best scenes in the series. When harry passes out from seeing the false memory why... WHY is it that Hermione is the who comes to him? Why Hermione only wtf. These movies ship Hermione and harry so much I can't even, thats a story for another day. Now all of the shit I just said, Has nothing compared to whats next. 

**9. THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES** 

This. This right here is the biggest reason I hate and despise this fucking movie. This movie ruined the best fight scene in all of Harry Potter and I will not stand for it. Before I get into the fight I wanna talk about something else, Kreacher. Why does harry or anyone else get the fucking idea to contact Kreacher. He's in grimmauld place and they did it in the books, And the fact that he betrayed Sirius is heartbreaking and the worst part is, he told all of this to Dumbledore while laughing. And why is harry like ''I'm doing this alone bye bye'' right before they were about to leave? JUST LEAVE UMRBIDGE ISN'T HERE YOU'RE BASICALLY GIVING HER TIME TO CATCH YOU BOZOS! okay lets just get into the actual fight. They go into the ministry go to level 9 (see what I did there? ;D) and here's where the problems lie. Where the actual Frick is the entrance to the department of mysteries? the entrance itself was part of the place and its not even there wtf, they just walk into a lift and boom they're in the prophecy room. Now here is where my problems lie, IMO this is the greatest fight scene in all of HP. Usually in fights its basically like just duels like 2 homeboys using expelliarmus or something and that is Kinda annoying. The spells can be the same but the place doesn't need to be, having this fight in the department makes it so anything can fucking happen, because the logic allows for it. You wanna have a jar of brains that strangle you? fuck it go ahead. The department is full so much weirdo shit and I fucking love that, this fight scene is what makes this book a masterpiece. now lets look at the movie... OMFG THEY JUST FUCKING CUT OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE FUCKING ROOMS! WTF MOVIE YOU HAD ONE JOB IDFC WHAT EXCUSE THEY HAD IF THEY COULDN'T DO IT RIGHT THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT AT ALL! YOU CUT OUT THE BRAINS, THE TIME ROOM, THE SPACE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, THE WEIRDO ROOM THAT NOBODY CAN OPEN. BUT YOU KEEP THE PROPHECY ROOM AND THE DEATH CHAMBER? WHY! YOU COULD'VE MADE ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTS IN ALL OF HP HISTORY BUT NO! YOU JUST HAD TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING DIDN'T YOU! NOW LETS GET INTO THE ACTUAL FIGHT. IN THE BOOKS THERE'S A FUCKING BABY HEADED DEATH EATER WALKING AROUND, DOLOHOV USES SOME KIND OF PURPLE FLAME THINGY, HERMIONE SILENCES THIS DUDE, NEVILLE GET HIS NOSE BROKEN AND JABS HIS WAND INTO DEATH EATER'S EYES, RON GETS STRANGLED BY BRAINS! HOW COOL DOES THAT SOUND THE MOVIE JUST FUCKING CUT OUT EVERYTHING THAT I JUST SAID. ITS STUPID, ITS A DISGRACE, ITS HORRIBLE! LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOI LOOK! THATS JUST THE FIGHT ITSELF LETS TALK ABOUT THE REASON EVERYONE IS EVEN FUCKING THERE! THE PROPHECY! THEY MAKE HARRY HEAR THE DAMN PROPHECY BEFORE HE GOES INTO DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE WHAT THE FUCK! IN THE BOOKS IT GETS DESTROYED BY NEVILLE'S DANCING LEGS WHICH IS HILARIOUS! NEVILLE BROKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM HIS LEGS LMFAO. BUT IN THE MOVIES SIRIUS JUST PUNCHES LUCIUS AND DROPS THE DAMN THING BRUH! NOW LETS TALK ABOUT SIRIUS'S DEATH WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! THE FACT THAT HE JUST FALLS THROUGH THE VEIL IS HEARTBREAKING AND HARRY THINKING HE WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE, BUT LUPIN TELLS HIM THE TRUTH, HE ISN'T COMING BACK AND HE NEVER DOES. HARRY KEEPS SHOUTING SIRIUS AT THE VEIL THINKING HIS GODFATHER WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE SMILING AT HIM BUT NO, HE DOESN'T COME BACK. THE MOVIE SAYS FUCK THAT SHIT AND HAS HIM DIE FROM THE AVADA KEDAVRA SO THE VEIL DIDN'T KILL HIM IN THE MOVIES IT WAS THE KILLING CURSE WTF AND HARRY SEE GET HIT BY IT SO WHY WOULD HE THINK HE'LL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE? OH YEAH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T THINK THAT! THIS MOVIE TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE OOTP SO AMAZING AND UNIQUE AND JUST THREW IT OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW. WHY IS IT THAT IN THE MOVIE ITS BELLATRIX TAUNTING HARRY BUT IN THE BOOKS ITS HARRY TAUNTING BELLATRIX TO THE POINT WHERE SHE'S ACTUALLY SCARED WTF!. DUMBLEDORE VS VOLDEMORT SUCKED I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, WHEN VOLDEMORT POSSESSED HARRY IT WAS PAIN BEYOND ANYTHING HE HAD EVER IMAGINED AND HE WANTED TO DIE! HE WANTED TO FUCKING DIE! AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE FACT THAT HE WILL SEE SIRIUS WHEN HE DIED! HIS GRIEF OVERCAME VOLDEMORTS POWER AND THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. IN THE MOVIE HOWEVER YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT IT WAS? OH YEAH HIS FRIENDS! THAT IS THE MOST CHEEZY SHIT EVER HIS FRIENDS AIN'T GUNNA DO SHIT THEY JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH LIKE THIS IS SOME TV SHOW EPISODE OR SOMETING AND HE FUCKING THINKS ABOUT HIS FRIENDS RATHER THEN SEEING HIS DEAD GODFATHER WHEN HE DIED. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HE SAYS TO VOLDEMORT? ''I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU'' OMFG THAT IS THE STUPID SHIT EVER! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT Harry Potter? THE BOY WHO SUFFERED SO MANY TIMES BY VOLDEMORT WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HE DID? AFTER ALL THE PEOPLE HE LOVED THAT HE KILLED AND HIS DEATH EATERS KILLED DO YOU REALLY FUCKING THINK HARRY WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? FUCK NO OFC NOT THIS MOVIE IS LOSING BRAINCELLS BY THE MINUTE THIS BASICALLY SOLIDIFIES THIS AS THE WORST Harry Potter MOVIE EVER MADE I HATE THIS FUCKING SHIT SO MUCH AND WHAT WHERE THE FUCK IS SIRIUS'S MIRROR? WHERE'S HARRY TALKING TO NEARLY HEADLESS NICK? WHERE'S DUMBLEDORE TELLING HARRY EVERYTHING? WTF THIS MOVIE IS A DISASTER.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

She doesn&amp;#39;t ban him from quidditch, she doesn&amp;#39;t give him multiple detentions, she doesn&amp;#39;t put Hagrid on probation and doesn&amp;#39;t ban harry from hogsmeade. In the books harry wanted to basically leave Hogwarts, she makes his life hell at Hogwarts. And her appearance is not even close to how she was described in the books. I once showed a picture of how umbridge looked like in the books in a discord chat and everyone was fucking disgusted and I don&amp;#39;t think people were disgusted when they saw how she was in the movie no offence to actor she played her fine but its mainly the fact that she&amp;#39;s not as despicable as she was in the books. Oh yeah and the quibbler thing with was amazing and I hate the they cut it out and where&amp;#39;s Firenze that was funny, the fact that Dumbledore hired a teacher just to annoy umbridge is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. DUMBLEDORE&amp;#39;S ARMY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that a huge part of this book was just butchered down into into a montage and half a class is horrible. This shit was fun as hell in the books, seeing the kids rebelling against umbridge and the entire ministry is amazing I loved it so much. And neville finding the room of requirement by accident is fucking dumb af and how does Hermione even know about the room in the first place? you siriusly telling me that Hermione knows what this room does and doesn&amp;#39;t know where its at, EVEN THOUGH DUMBLEDORE TOLD HARRY LAST YEAR bruh just bruh. Where the coins at? those shit were the best and its used in the later books, Draco using it in book 6 and neville using it to call people in the battle of Hogwarts and its like why cut this out the books came out before the movie came out so its even more stupider. And Dobby, thats all I have to say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. St Mungo&amp;#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, “Thanks Mum.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any- thing less funny in his life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats all I have to say, They cut out this incredible scene and I will never forgive them for cutting this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Snape&amp;#39;s Worst Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn what an amazning chapter. Occulmency is so much fun like reading I fucking love it so much, its like watching a film reel I in a book, but in the movies it just happens so quickly and fast and they just use it as an excuse to reuse old footage from the other movies for nostalgic purposes, and thats annoying in the books we mostly see stuff we never knew before. Snape in the books was cruel in these lessons and not encouraging enough but in the movies he doesn&amp;#39;t really do much. For example when harry see&amp;#39;s his memory, in the books he throws a jar of dead crockroaches, in the movie Snape just tells him to get out. Now the actual scene in fucking stupid in the movies, thats not even what protego does and the pensive isn&amp;#39;t even fucking there, its so fascinating to see what Hogwarts was like back then and see what the marauders were like but in the film we just see them hanging Snape and thats it. There&amp;#39;s a deleted scene not really scene, which shows lily with them but for some reason they cut it out. They forget the most important part, there&amp;#39;s a reason this is called Snape&amp;#39;s worst memory he called his best friend a mud blood and regretted his entire life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. O.W.L.s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh my god. The movie mentions this and tell us how important this is, AND THE DON&amp;#39;T EVEN SHOW IT.  Even in the HBP movie mcgonnagoll mentions that harry wants to become an auror BUT HE NEVER EVEN HAD HIS CARRER ADVICE WTF. And now the actual exams, only a series like Harry Potter could make exams fun. Its weird to say but I love reading the exams and all the kids being stressed and its so fascinating to see how wizards do their exams, But the movies just doesn&amp;#39;t really care about Hogwarts being a school. Look how many classes are in these movies, Barely any. And where tf is Hagrid hulk smashing umbridge and her ministry cronies? that shit was phenomenal I loved that so much and then mcgonnagoll gets four stunning spells to the chest, and they cut it all out. Istg this movie is falling apart, OOTP isn&amp;#39;t even my favourite book in the series, but it has some of the best scenes in the series. When harry passes out from seeing the false memory why... WHY is it that Hermione is the who comes to him? Why Hermione only wtf. These movies ship Hermione and harry so much I can&amp;#39;t even, thats a story for another day. Now all of the shit I just said, Has nothing compared to whats next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This. This right here is the biggest reason I hate and despise this fucking movie. This movie ruined the best fight scene in all of Harry Potter and I will not stand for it. Before I get into the fight I wanna talk about something else, Kreacher. Why does harry or anyone else get the fucking idea to contact Kreacher. He&amp;#39;s in grimmauld place and they did it in the books, And the fact that he betrayed Sirius is heartbreaking and the worst part is, he told all of this to Dumbledore while laughing. And why is harry like &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m doing this alone bye bye&amp;#39;&amp;#39; right before they were about to leave? JUST LEAVE UMRBIDGE ISN&amp;#39;T HERE YOU&amp;#39;RE BASICALLY GIVING HER TIME TO CATCH YOU BOZOS! okay lets just get into the actual fight. They go into the ministry go to level 9 (see what I did there? ;D) and here&amp;#39;s where the problems lie. Where the actual Frick is the entrance to the department of mysteries? the entrance itself was part of the place and its not even there wtf, they just walk into a lift and boom they&amp;#39;re in the prophecy room. Now here is where my problems lie, IMO this is the greatest fight scene in all of HP. Usually in fights its basically like just duels like 2 homeboys using expelliarmus or something and that is Kinda annoying. The spells can be the same but the place doesn&amp;#39;t need to be, having this fight in the department makes it so anything can fucking happen, because the logic allows for it. You wanna have a jar of brains that strangle you? fuck it go ahead. The department is full so much weirdo shit and I fucking love that, this fight scene is what makes this book a masterpiece. now lets look at the movie... OMFG THEY JUST FUCKING CUT OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE FUCKING ROOMS! WTF MOVIE YOU HAD ONE JOB IDFC WHAT EXCUSE THEY HAD IF THEY COULDN&amp;#39;T DO IT RIGHT THEN THEY SHOULDN&amp;#39;T HAVE DONE IT AT ALL! YOU CUT OUT THE BRAINS, THE TIME ROOM, THE SPACE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, THE WEIRDO ROOM THAT NOBODY CAN OPEN. BUT YOU KEEP THE PROPHECY ROOM AND THE DEATH CHAMBER? WHY! YOU COULD&amp;#39;VE MADE ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTS IN ALL OF HP HISTORY BUT NO! YOU JUST HAD TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING DIDN&amp;#39;T YOU! NOW LETS GET INTO THE ACTUAL FIGHT. IN THE BOOKS THERE&amp;#39;S A FUCKING BABY HEADED DEATH EATER WALKING AROUND, DOLOHOV USES SOME KIND OF PURPLE FLAME THINGY, HERMIONE SILENCES THIS DUDE, NEVILLE GET HIS NOSE BROKEN AND JABS HIS WAND INTO DEATH EATER&amp;#39;S EYES, RON GETS STRANGLED BY BRAINS! HOW COOL DOES THAT SOUND THE MOVIE JUST FUCKING CUT OUT EVERYTHING THAT I JUST SAID. ITS STUPID, ITS A DISGRACE, ITS HORRIBLE! LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOI LOOK! THATS JUST THE FIGHT ITSELF LETS TALK ABOUT THE REASON EVERYONE IS EVEN FUCKING THERE! THE PROPHECY! THEY MAKE HARRY HEAR THE DAMN PROPHECY BEFORE HE GOES INTO DUMBLEDORE&amp;#39;S OFFICE WHAT THE FUCK! IN THE BOOKS IT GETS DESTROYED BY NEVILLE&amp;#39;S DANCING LEGS WHICH IS HILARIOUS! NEVILLE BROKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM HIS LEGS LMFAO. BUT IN THE MOVIES SIRIUS JUST PUNCHES LUCIUS AND DROPS THE DAMN THING BRUH! NOW LETS TALK ABOUT SIRIUS&amp;#39;S DEATH WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! THE FACT THAT HE JUST FALLS THROUGH THE VEIL IS HEARTBREAKING AND HARRY THINKING HE WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE, BUT LUPIN TELLS HIM THE TRUTH, HE ISN&amp;#39;T COMING BACK AND HE NEVER DOES. HARRY KEEPS SHOUTING SIRIUS AT THE VEIL THINKING HIS GODFATHER WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE SMILING AT HIM BUT NO, HE DOESN&amp;#39;T COME BACK. THE MOVIE SAYS FUCK THAT SHIT AND HAS HIM DIE FROM THE AVADA KEDAVRA SO THE VEIL DIDN&amp;#39;T KILL HIM IN THE MOVIES IT WAS THE KILLING CURSE WTF AND HARRY SEE GET HIT BY IT SO WHY WOULD HE THINK HE&amp;#39;LL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE? OH YEAH BECAUSE HE DOESN&amp;#39;T THINK THAT! THIS MOVIE TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE OOTP SO AMAZING AND UNIQUE AND JUST THREW IT OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW. WHY IS IT THAT IN THE MOVIE ITS BELLATRIX TAUNTING HARRY BUT IN THE BOOKS ITS HARRY TAUNTING BELLATRIX TO THE POINT WHERE SHE&amp;#39;S ACTUALLY SCARED WTF!. DUMBLEDORE VS VOLDEMORT SUCKED I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, WHEN VOLDEMORT POSSESSED HARRY IT WAS PAIN BEYOND ANYTHING HE HAD EVER IMAGINED AND HE WANTED TO DIE! HE WANTED TO FUCKING DIE! AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE FACT THAT HE WILL SEE SIRIUS WHEN HE DIED! HIS GRIEF OVERCAME VOLDEMORTS POWER AND THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. IN THE MOVIE HOWEVER YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT IT WAS? OH YEAH HIS FRIENDS! THAT IS THE MOST CHEEZY SHIT EVER HIS FRIENDS AIN&amp;#39;T GUNNA DO SHIT THEY JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH LIKE THIS IS SOME TV SHOW EPISODE OR SOMETING AND HE FUCKING THINKS ABOUT HIS FRIENDS RATHER THEN SEEING HIS DEAD GODFATHER WHEN HE DIED. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HE SAYS TO VOLDEMORT? &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU&amp;#39;&amp;#39; OMFG THAT IS THE STUPID SHIT EVER! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT Harry Potter? THE BOY WHO SUFFERED SO MANY TIMES BY VOLDEMORT WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HE DID? AFTER ALL THE PEOPLE HE LOVED THAT HE KILLED AND HIS DEATH EATERS KILLED DO YOU REALLY FUCKING THINK HARRY WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM? FUCK NO OFC NOT THIS MOVIE IS LOSING BRAINCELLS BY THE MINUTE THIS BASICALLY SOLIDIFIES THIS AS THE WORST Harry Potter MOVIE EVER MADE I HATE THIS FUCKING SHIT SO MUCH AND WHAT WHERE THE FUCK IS SIRIUS&amp;#39;S MIRROR? WHERE&amp;#39;S HARRY TALKING TO NEARLY HEADLESS NICK? WHERE&amp;#39;S DUMBLEDORE TELLING HARRY EVERYTHING? WTF THIS MOVIE IS A DISASTER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Minor Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Harry not beating up Draco&amp;#39;s ass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Quidditch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Cho Chang &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Peeves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Percy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Hagrid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Mcgonnagoll vs Umbridge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Basically any class they have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Spell colours and uses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Dumbledore&amp;#39;s remember my last letter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Neville being the chosen one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ladies and gentlemen is without a doubt, the worst Harry Potter movie ever made. I will Never watch this shit show again and I will gladly give this movie a...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"\- ""Light Drama"" based around the founding and founders of Hogwarts. The rift between Slytherin and the others would be the main point of conflict.

\- The Marauders, Lilly, Snape, etc at Hogwarts.

\- The formation of the Order and the first fight against Voldemort

\-Set right after the fall of Voldemort, a crime/detective movie with Mad-Eye as the main character. Set around him tracking down/prosecuting old Death Eaters.

\-A ""comeback kids"" sports movie about a struggling Quidditch club that comes out of nowhere to win the league. Chudley Cannons would be a fun team to base it on. Ron's favorite and a team that has been known to struggle

\-Since we don't see or hear about him much, a movie based on Charlie Weasley's adventures in Romania. Would be cool to see different kinds of dragons. Thought it could be set in the summer time and have Hagrid join him/help him for the break. That way the fans can still see a beloved character in this new setting/story.

\-After JK released the names and locations of the different wizarding schools, would be cool to see a movie set in one of the ""foreign"" schools.

\-This one is a stretch haha: Based on Bill Weasley, a financial/Wall Street type thriller about the relationship between goblins and wizards.

,harrypotter,"For a long time, I've been of the belief that the house system in Harry Potter is a really bad idea. Imagine you're going into sixth grade. Before you can start classes, your teacher tells you you have to be in a category that are essentially boiled down to good, evil, friendly, and smart. And you don't even get to decide! A hundred-year-old piece of headware that introduces itself through song is going to decide what box you fit in for the next seven years. That wouldn't fly, right?

I think it would've been a lot more interesting if the houses were academic courses. For example, Ravenclaws get advanced classes and much more in-depth coursework. Slytherins can choose electives and drop core classes earlier than the other houses in order to pursue their ambition. I'm not sure about Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs, but maybe Hufflepuffs have less coursework in favor of getting involved in the community (joining clubs, quidditch, volunteer work, etc.) and Gryffindors have a DADA/Auror/curse-breaking focus. For the first year, students don't have a house and are able to get to know each other without house lines dividing them. At the end of the year they decide on a house depending on what they want to get out of their Hogwarts experience.

It just always rubbed me the wrong way the way the house system functioned. Imagine you get sorted into Slytherin after hearing your whole life that they're the evil house and that only dark wizards are sorted there? That would be devastating to an eleven-year-old.

,harrypotter,"I suppose this might be long, as I am prone to rambling occasionally. I just wanted to warn everyone ahead of time.

I am definitely out of the age bracket for an ordinary first-time Harry Potter reader. I was 24 when the first book was released.
I had a stepson who was a little too young for Harry Potter at the time. By the time he was old enough, he had other interests. I knew for certain that this was something I would have obsessed over had it come out when I was young. Fast forward to 2018. I don't know why, but I decided that this was as good a time as any to step into the world of Hogwarts. I listened to all the books on Audible during my commute to and from work. It was, no pun intended, magical. I would get a light feeling in my stomach and I couldn't wait to hear what was next. When I was about 10 years old, my mother and I were at a yard sale and I found a box full of old D&amp;D books. I bought them and was hooked instantly. That was the last time I felt as giddy as I did by listening to the Harry Potter books. 

Over time, both real-time and book time, something changed. These precocious children were getting older, and I noticed that my patience for them was thinning. I'm certain that had I started the books as a young man, then I would have felt differently. I was not reading them as a young man, though. I was reading them as an adult with a family of my own. The fact of the matter is, as the children got older, I grew less fond of them. Here they were, wizards and witches, living in a world of wonder, and all they seemed to do was whine and complain.

I listened to all the books even though as they went on it felt more like a chore than a pleasure. I was hoping for an incredible rush of emotion at the end, but that didn't happen for me. I felt that the pacing was rushed later in the story, and perhaps Rowling was just trying to finish the thing and put it behind her. It was a shame because the early books were so amazing.

Now here we are today. I still look in on what is happening in the online world of Harry Potter. I like to see what people are thinking and reading all the fan theories. I still enjoy Harry Potter, in fact, I am watching the first movie as I type this. I still have only seen the first two movies. I still get a little tingle in my belly thinking about how I felt reading the first few books. I even ordered a custom wand and everything. I still can't wait to go to Hogwarts on a vacation sometime, even though I will have to settle for the Orlando version. 

If you're still reading this, thank you. Thank you for letting an old man pour out the feelings he has for a series of books that he is too old for.

&lt;p&gt;Now here we are today. I still look in on what is happening in the online world of Harry Potter. I like to see what people are thinking and reading all the fan theories. I still enjoy Harry Potter, in fact, I am watching the first movie as I type this. I still have only seen the first two movies. I still get a little tingle in my belly thinking about how I felt reading the first few books. I even ordered a custom wand and everything. I still can&amp;#39;t wait to go to Hogwarts on a vacation sometime, even though I will have to settle for the Orlando version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re still reading this, thank you. Thank you for letting an old man pour out the feelings he has for a series of books that he is too old for. I think I will continue reading and watching Harry Potter, I just might stop when the children are of a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"I've just completed a reread of *The Deathly Hallows* (actually, of the whole series); the first time since it first came out in 2007. At the time, I had no strong reactions to the Epilogue, but the poor recreation in the film adaptation and the general tone of discussions about it had led to think of it as a particularly shoddy piece of writing.

I was pleasantly surprised then that it's well... *fine*, and far from the weakest writing in this novel in particular\*. I tried reading some articles and prior discussions on this subreddit, and from what I gather, some of the themes of the complaints revolve around the fact that it's a lightweight piece of fluff, and the names Harry picked out for his kids.

As an addendum to the story, however, I feel like the entire point of the chapter's existence is to hammer home the fact that peace and tranquility has been restored to the world our characters inhabit. Its very mundanity is the key to its existence; after the final confrontation and its immediate aftermath, Rowling seemed to want to emphasize what it was all for: so children can see their kids off to school, and for those kids to be able joke around, tease each other, and not have to worry about anything other than learning and enjoying themselves. For Harry as a character, it's the easygoing existence he was always denied, and for us as readers, it's a return to the relatively lighthearted tone of the first novels - the excitement that accompanied a step into a world filled with wonder, but not necessarily danger.

As for the names of the kids, to be honest, the worst thing I can point out about them is their predictability, and that's only because it's so appropriate. *Of course* Harry named two of them after his dead parents; if he didn't, Rowling would've had to work to justify it, and that wasn't the point of the chapter. As for Albus Severus, he of the green eyes and more sensitive temperament, it's all the more meaningful. A running arc throughout *Deathly Hallows* is Harry reconciling his view of Dumbledore and how much the latter had shaped his, Harry's, life with the reality of his actions and history. The chapter ""King's Cross"" is devoted almost entirely to resolving this lingering tension: Harry learns the truth about his mentor, comes to understand the circumstances and motivations behind the choices he made, including the ugly ones. Ultimately, Harry accepts that whatever and whoever Dumbledore was, he helped shape Harry into the man he had become, a man Dumbledore himself considered greater than he. Learning about Snape was similar, in that Harry was confronted with the realization that his own judgment of Snape's character was misinformed and made without an understanding of key factors that drove Snape's actions and decision-making. Though both flawed human beings (and yes, Snape moreso than Dumbledore), they ultimately rose over those flaws (unlike Voldemort, who could never master his own vanity and power-lust) and died as heroes. It makes perfect sense that the spotlighted son would be named after these two characters specifically, at the end of this particular book especially.

\*While I loved the climax of Harry's central character arc, particularly the way the themes of self-sacrifice and acceptance of mortality play into the resolution of the conflict, there was much about *Deathly Hallows*' writing that I found weaker compared to the best of the series. Off the top of my head, Voldemort summoning the Sorting Hat to enable Neville to draw the sword and kill Nagini felt incredibly contrived (as well as anti-climactic compared to everything that happened prior), and Mrs. Weasley having a Big Damn Heroes moment felt goofy. Much of the set-up and payoff of the mysteries in *Hallows* was weaker, mainly due to the structure.

As a wizard, how does he know about roller skates? Since they're a Muggles type of physical activity/possible transportation method. Am I missing something? (I'm also severely sleep deprived at the moment, so apologies if I point anything out that's extremely obvious or if I've glossed over some obvious detail(s) related to this)

It's only the third movie/book, so Harry or Hermione wouldn't have brought them up in any conversations yet, nor has he been out in the Muggle world compared to later books, where he would've seen someone use them? Nor do they have TVs where he could've watched it in a movie or something

I think it's a really subtle, but interesting moment to think about. The crossover of certain toys or contraptions from the Muggle world into the Wizarding world. Where is the line drawn on knowledge/applications of such things? This also makes me think of the joke shop the twins had. The scene where the Umbridge figurine is forced to cross a tightrope on a unicycle.

I guess one could apply this question to when Parvati turned the giant king cobra to a creepy-ass clown too?

Is this a possibility of there being wizarding circuses out in their world?

&lt;p&gt;As a wizard, how does he know about roller skates? Since they&amp;#39;re a Muggles type of physical activity/possible transportation method. Am I missing something? (I&amp;#39;m also severely sleep deprived at the moment, so apologies if I point anything out that&amp;#39;s extremely obvious or if I&amp;#39;ve glossed over some obvious detail(s) related to this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only the third movie/book, so Harry or Hermione wouldn&amp;#39;t have brought them up in any conversations yet, nor has he been out in the Muggle world compared to later books, where he would&amp;#39;ve seen someone use them? Nor do they have TVs where he could&amp;#39;ve watched it in a movie or something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a really subtle, but interesting moment to think about. The crossover of certain toys or contraptions from the Muggle world into the Wizarding world. Where is the line drawn on knowledge/applications of such things? This also makes me think of the joke shop the twins had. The scene where the Umbridge figurine is forced to cross a tightrope on a unicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess one could apply this question to when Parvati turned the giant king cobra to a creepy-ass clown too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a possibility of there being wizarding circuses out in their world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is this a &amp;quot;anything not related to technology&amp;quot; is fair game to being a part of the wizarding world even though they wouldn&amp;#39;t really use those things commonly, just for entertainment, because of their magical abilities?

If it was about werewolves being exposed to the moon, Lupin could have just stayed in his office and never transformed.

2. When Lupin describes the wolfsbane potion, he says if he takes it the entire week preceding the full moon, he keeps his mind when he transforms. So even if he did not take it that night, he should have still been in control and transformation should have been bearable by the books own rules.

If Dumbledore used imperious on a first year, would he be limited to the skill level of the victim? Or would the victim be able to do anything Dumbledore is capable of? 

Would it be a once-and-done type spell, or would Dumbledore have to remember to let the victim use the bathroom or speak during class? 

If someone's talking to an Imperious victim, do they just answer on auto-pilot and say whatever Dumbledore would want them to say? 

Or is a small part of Dumbledore's consciousness inside the victim to respond in real time? 

Would the victim of Dumbledore's Imperious be able to pull off fire-y stunts with ease? 

When Draco is controlling Rosmerta, does Draco need to know how Rosemerta would normally act/work in order to avoid suspicion? 

Is is the caster able to incorporate the victim's normal behavior into the curse to avoid detection?

,harrypotter,"Hi! My partner and I just finished the movie series last night and LOOOOVVVVVED them. Hoping some of the more knowledgeable Harry Potter fans can help with this one, as the books (which I have not read *yet*) may do a better job of explaining this... (or maybe there’s som fan wisdom I don’t have yet).

In the movies, it seems that a dramatic emphasis is placed on explaining that Harry lived because of his **Mother** making the ultimate sacrifice and giving her life to save Harry’s. I feel like this comes up an awful lot throughout the movies, which is a *truly* beautiful sentiment. My questions, however... Did Harry’s Father not also make that same sacrifice by being killed by Voldemort protecting his wife &amp; son? 

Just curious why there seems to be so much emphasis on the “Mother’s love” &amp; not the “parents’ love” being what protected Harry.

,harrypotter,"I recently finished TDH again, after a couple years (also bought my own book set, hell yeah). I was nearing the end when I noticed something I'd never seem before.

In book 7, after the King's Cross dream, Harry has to play dead. Voldemort sends Narcissa Malfoy (Draco's mom) to check if Harry is dead. Thus us the part I finally noticed: Narcissa obviously sees that Harry is alive, but instead if blowing his cover, she asks if Draco is alive. When Harry says he his, Narcissa helps him out by saying he's dead.

Holy crap. I never paid too much attention to Narcissia before, outside of that one scene in HBP where she and Draco are at Madam Makins's. But seeing this now was mind-blowing. So I look her up on the HP wiki, and checked with the other books.

Narcissa is obviously still a blood purist, but she never actually joined the Death Eaters. She literally cared so much about her family that she *literally betrayed Voldemort*, because she knew the only way she could go and find her son was if she went back to Hogwarts. But she could only do that as a Death Eater. It also means Harry is inadvertently protected by a mother's love again.

,harrypotter,"I am here to list the pros and cons of being muggle-born.  


Pros

1. No annoying siblings at Hogwarts
2. (In accordance to 1)  You are a witch/wizard and your siblings are not #getRektSiblings
3. Eventually will have an understanding of both the wizarding and muggle communities
4. Amaze people with simple sleight of hand muggle magic tricks
5. Having a basic knowledge of science and mathematics 
6. Great songs
7. A technological understanding
8. You can survive without magic
9. It's all real.

These pros are mainly base around understanding things that wizards do not which is an excellent skill for many things such as, blending in with muggles. A wizard wouldn't expect you to be walking around with a phone in your hand and calling someone. These muggle skills are valuable and make you a more able person.   


Cons

1. Very small chance of Slytherin, if that is your house
2. Discrimination
3. Being like WTF at everything in the wizarding world. (ex: WTF is a dementor)
4. Not knowing any wizard friends
5. No technology at Hogwarts
6. Wizards don't know of anything you like (wizard: Why are the stars having wars???)
7. Can't read people's genius theories on reddit
8. Having to leave your pets. You might have a cat but it's ""The Family's""
9. Going into a state of dream-like shock upon figuring out one of your dreams came true.

These cons are based more upon not knowing, opposite the pros. I do believe that most of these cons are bearable in exchange for being a witch or a wizard, except for no. 1. I do think that there is a way around this. Hypothetically, in the muggle-born position, wishing to be in Slytherin is very ambitious, which is a trait of Slytherin, so the Sorting Hat would likely put one in Slytherin.

I’ve been a fan of the Harry Potter saga since I was a child and I want to get a tattoo but I can’t figure out what exactly I want to get. 
My favourite characters are the Weasley Twins and Draco Malfoy and I want to get a tattoo combining both but I don’t like realism style. 
At first I was thinking of doing 2 snakes. 2 because of the Twins and a snake representing Draco.. but I want to add details in each snake to be a little more interesting and to make more sense, like footsteps, patronus, or a wand but really, I don’t know.
I’m not going to ask for a drawing because it’s not your job, I just want help, an idea to clear up my mind.
I don’t have friends that like Harry Potter and they can’t advise me, that’s why I’m asking the internet, I just don’t know how to combine “good” and “evil”
I want another point of view and advise from someone that likes Harry Potter and could give me a good idea for a tattoo.

,harrypotter,"I still can’t get over the shock of the graveyard scene and the aftermath. 

I remember the first time I saw GOF I was a kid and of course I was watching it because it was Harry Potter and the visuals were cool, because I was a kid without the capacity to look at the deeper story line. 

The creepy rat looking dude from the last movie emerges from the gloom, and then all of a sudden, BAM, Cedric’s motionless on the ground and Harry’s getting choked by a statue’s sickle. And then I see the rat looking dude approach Harry and draw out a dagger and cut Harry’s arm open and the blood dripping from it. I bury my head in a pillow until the entire scene is over. Then I hear the Hogwarts music and Harry’s laying over motionless Cedric - why isn’t Cedric moving? And then it dawns on me like it dawns on the rest of the crowd - he’s dead. And then we see Harry’s arm cut in brighter lighting, and for some reason I thought he was close to death so I turned off the DVD player and put the movie away. 

I had nightmares about that scene for a few weeks and it was only when the Half Blood Prince came out (OOTP was already out, I just didn’t know about it), that I finally realized he didn’t die and was okay, so that got me comfortable with HP again.

I mean even now it still hits. I wince when I see his arm getting cut and it gives me chills when I see Cedric’s dead body laying there when Harry brings him back - the music playing and just how DEAD he looks.

&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time I saw GOF I was a kid and of course I was watching it because it was Harry Potter and the visuals were cool, because I was a kid without the capacity to look at the deeper story line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creepy rat looking dude from the last movie emerges from the gloom, and then all of a sudden, BAM, Cedric’s motionless on the ground and Harry’s getting choked by a statue’s sickle. And then I see the rat looking dude approach Harry and draw out a dagger and cut Harry’s arm open and the blood dripping from it. I bury my head in a pillow until the entire scene is over. Then I hear the Hogwarts music and Harry’s laying over motionless Cedric - why isn’t Cedric moving? And then it dawns on me like it dawns on the rest of the crowd - he’s dead. And then we see Harry’s arm cut in brighter lighting, and for some reason I thought he was close to death so I turned off the DVD player and put the movie away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had nightmares about that scene for a few weeks and it was only when the Half Blood Prince came out (OOTP was already out, I just didn’t know about it), that I finally realized he didn’t die and was okay, so that got me comfortable with HP again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean even now it still hits. I wince when I see his arm getting cut and it gives me chills when I see Cedric’s dead body laying there when Harry brings him back - the music playing and just how DEAD he looks. Like Cedric died at 17, I’ve made it past 17, and it chills me to think that if I were in his shoes in that universe it could’ve been me laying in that position. And then people’s reactions as the horror sets in... goddamn that’s messed up. &lt;/p&gt;

Hi All, 

I saw this and wanted to share it.

I could not post the link or the amazing back cover, which some of you may have seen already. What struck me were the recommendations from people and I no longer really know, and how the books have dwarfed those recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the main article-(from yahoo UK news)

A bookshop is offering two rare Harry Potter first editions for sale — for a whopping £107,500.

The books — an original paperback edition and hardback version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone — are believed to be the only two on sale in the whole of the country, with the only other paperback available in the United States.

They are now being sold by St Mary's Books in Stamford, Lincolnshire who are hoping to fetch a six-figure sum for the rare finds.

While the first edition paperback, released in 1997, was once available for £4.99 it is on sale for £12,500.

The hardback edition released at the same time, with only 500 copies printed, has a £95,000 price tag — working out at £426 per page.

Shop owner Marcus Tyers, 40, from Stamford, said: “The hardback is extremely rare and is the sort of book that could have been sitting in your bookcase for a long time.

“The paperback is an interesting one in that it's from the exact same sheets and pages as the hardback as they were printed at the same time.

“The only difference is the hardback was printed 500 times whereas the softback was published 5,000 times.""",t2_2nu38zlm,False,,0,False,"Independent bookshop is selling rare Harry Potter first editions for a combined £107,500","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'News'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,news,0,,,False,t3_m09y81,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},News,False,4,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615214954.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All, &lt;/p&gt;

It’s possible JKR didn’t want to change the iconic trio, but I think it would have worked.

In fact I think it would have been awesome to see them grow a kind of competitor’s respect and actually bond over the danger of the tournament. In fact it would have been awesome if they all fought Voldy and the death eaters together at the end (not sure how the plot would have to change to make this work, but still) and then mourn together over Cedric’s death.

,harrypotter,"TL;DR: Pottermore/Wizarding World only has three wand ‘looks’. I bought a replica before I realised this and I feel cheated because every wand is supposed to be unique.

\*\*\*

Hi, I’m Dakky.

I recently logged onto the Wizarding World website (originally Pottermore, I believe) and I got sorted into my house, found out my wand and discovered my Patronus.

Sorted into Ravenclaw: perfect. I know I’m smack-bang in the middle of Ravenclaw and Slytherin, but I believe I pertain to Ravenclaw more effectively, so I’m happy with that choice.

Patronus was a hedgehog: was a bit underwhelming (especially considering I have friends who have been assigned Hippogriffs before…) but, upon thinking about it, I do feel quite like a hedgehog, I suppose. I’m a little harsh on the outside but kind on the inside. I’m also small, if that has anything to do with it (which it probably doesn’t in the wizarding world, but who knows…)

But then there was the wand. Now, the wand thing really pees me off. Not because I have anything against a 10” Chestnut hard wand with a Unicorn hair core – but because there are ONLY. THREE. IMAGES. OF. WANDS.

When I found out this piece of information, I was like… are you JOKING me? Because I was extremely excited about my Wizarding World/Pottermore wand, so I bought a replica online. It basically feels like I’ve been cheated, because it’s not *truly* what my wand would have looked like, is it? Especially considering Ollivander said that no two wands are the same.

Of course, he didn’t just mean visually, he also meant internally and temperamentally – but the look of the wand can’t just be disregarded when he stated that no two wands are the same, otherwise how would we have multiple extremely unique wands from the movies?

I just feel sort of cheated, because I bought my wand thinking it was unique. That perhaps there would be more than just a handful of wand looks.(There isn’t even a HANDFUL, there’s THREE.)

I really wanted to get a wand that connects with ME. Not that is coded to a few silly questions about my height and eye colour.

I know the wand chooses the wizard and there’s no TRUE way to get that to happen in real life… and I know that I’m kind of just seeking out a different wand even though the Wizarding World wand ‘chose’ me… but I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel legitimate to me. It’s unsatisfying to say the least.

So, FINALLY, here’s the question. Does anyone know where I could have someone actually assess me and pair me with a suitable wand?Someone who designs wands and who can help me get a wand look that resonates with me?Someone who maybe knows a lot about wands in the HP universe and can help me with this?Someone like (dare I say) a metaphorical Ollivander?

I guess I just want to be original because I know, should the HP universe be real, everyone’s wand would be.

Thanks for reading my rant haha! I’m sure no one will reply or help because I understand that it’s a tricky question to answer. But, if anyone does take the time to respond and help me out, I’d be extremely thankful.

Thanks everyone!

&lt;p&gt;So does this mean that theoretically a dementor could have sucked Voldemort&amp;#39;s soul out of Harry (and sure would have sucked out Harry&amp;#39;s own soul too). Would this then have destroyed the soul as we hear that once a dementor takes your soul, that&amp;#39;s it, your toast, there&amp;#39;s no getting it back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you all think?&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"currently reading half blood prince and there's a scene in chapter 24 where harry has detention with snape after using sectumsempra on malfoy. 

he's asked to sort out old files of past hogwarts students and the punishments that they received for rule breaking.

snape suggests that harry start w box 1012 - 1056 and the first file harry pulls out is about james and sirius.

now i don't think i have to elaborate on why this is significant but this is just another instance where snape is purposefully insensitive towards harry and takes pleasure in his misery. pls keep in mind that harry is only 16 at the time. he is a child that has experienced an unfortunate and unfathomable amount of trauma and loss for his age that should in no way be mocked. yet snape finds every y opportunity to do so .

I think it's mentioned that Sirius would have been too obvious of a choice, and so the Death Eaters would have tracked him down to get the information they needed straight away. Therefore they chose Peter instead, who no one would have expected to be trusted with such important information. 

But even if they did track Sirius- so what? They could have tortured him all they wanted, but I'm certain that Sirius would have never given in. He even says so himself that he would have died before giving up his friends:

,harrypotter,"now im sure we all know that before snape worked for dumbledore he was a death eater spying for voldemort.

for the sake of this discussion ill be refrencing the prophecy. for a slight recap: trelawney and dumbledore are in the hogs head where trelawney relays the prophecy regarding voldemort and the chosen one to dumbledore. snape, a death eater at the time, overhears and reports what he heard to voldemort thus causing a series of unfortunate events that ultimately lead to the deaths of lily and james potter.

now i personally believe that although this was described as snapes biggest regret i still believe he should not have been allowed a job at hogwarts/redemption and let me share why. 

during the scene where harry finds out that snape was the one who told voldemort abt the prophecy dumbledore states that snape had no way of knowing that harrys parents would be voldemorts target. however had he known what outcome his actions would have had he would not have proceeded. thus i believe that snape only viewed working for voldemort as his ""biggest regret"" because lily, the woman he loved, was murdered due to voldemorts interpretation of the prophecy. but had it been anyone else i don't think he would have cared as much. 

lily dying is seen as snapes turning point and the sole reason dumbledore trusted him to work alongside him. but what if it had been anyone other than lily? would he still have changed?

Hate the Cursed Child?

Ever wondered why Harry is not behaving like himself in it? or why we barely see him or the original trio at all? Why Cedric Diggory ever becomes a Death Eater? What's the deal with Voldemort having kids? And what's with all the time travel, didn't JK Rowling specifically say she smashed all of the Time-Turners in OP to get rid of this plot device?

**What if we could make the Cursed Child better? What if we could make it fit better within the Harry Potter series?**

I'm working on a ""fix"" of the Cursed Child story with my own (upcoming) series of books (Harry Potter and The Lost Child is the first of five):

[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13823288/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Lost-Child)

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon adherent, the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Review and Suggestions are welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

Okay why is Harry Potter hated? 

usually people hate him cuz he's just kinda like a blank slate which I agree with he is in the first 4 books just kinda a whatever kinda guy yk? and then book 5 is where harry starts to become an actual character and where people start to hate him unpopular opinion angsty harry is the fucking best when harry is angry in book 5 he's not just spilling out anger from what happened in the graveyard no he's spilling out anger from 10 years of torment from the dursleys abusive treatment he had nobody before he went to Hogwarts he could not even go to mrs figg bcz she knew if he had too much fun he would Never be able to go and that is tragic not alot of people focus on harry's childhood he had a horrible childhood but he still remained a good kid at heart but what happened in the graveyard broke him but really broke him was learning the wizarding world didn't even believe him he just saw and experienced the most traumatic thing that happened to him at this point and you know what the people around him do? they call him the worst thing anyone can ever call him at this point... a liar a fucking liar and this shit changes a kid and to top it all of he has to go to the dursleys and stay with them all summer stealing newspapers out of bins and hiding in bushes and he has nobody to talk to none of his friends are even writing to him they're just giving him cryptic ass msgs and the one man whom harry had always known who could make things right Dumbledore didn't even acknowledge that he and harry we're on the same planet he wouldn't even look him in the eye and harry thinks he's being possessed by Voldemort and then when he finally gets to rage and let his anger out on his friends they don't argue back they comfort him and then Fred and George show up and start cracking jokes to ease the tension and then harry goes to Hogwarts where his anger is more now nobody is believing him they all think he's some crazy ass attention seeking bitch and that Voldemort is not even back and then there's umbridge who makes harry's life hell banning him from quidditch putting Hagrid on probation and ruining his life at Hogwarts and then you know what he does he starts his own DADA lessons and he's the teacher and he's loving he's finally getting the happiness he deserves until dumbleodre's army gets caught and Dumbledore leaves the school and umbrage is headmaster now jumping forward a bit harry's at the department of mysteries and then he see's the only family he has left just die right before his eyes and harry's not believing none of it wanting to go through so bad thinking that Sirius will come out of the other side of the veil smiling or something but he doesn't Sirius never kept harry waiting before and then he chases after bellatrix and he's mega angry rn failing to do the cruciatis curse and taunting bellatrix fast forward to Dumbledore's office he's there and he wants to leave as hard as he can but the door won't open and then he starts trashing Dumbledore's office screaming till his throat hurts wanting to kill himself wanting to hurt Dumbledore and wanting to die... that Is some powerful shit to make it worse he hears the truth about how Sirius died and is even more angry and feels more guilty but nothing can even come close to what happens when harry goes into his dormitory and see's the package Sirius gave him just lying and he didn't even open it and it was a 2 way mirror harry could've saved Sirius is if he just opened it and asked if Sirius was there he kept shouting at the mirror but he only say his own green eyes staring at it and then to make matters worse he goes to nearly headless and asks him if Sirius will come back as a ghost hoping that Sirius willl come out of the other side of that wall transparent and smiling at harry but alas Sirius never comes and harry finally accepts that his godfather is truly gone and that is truly heartbreaking angsty harry is harry at his best he's the harry we never expected he's not some kid who's being a meanie head at his friends he's a broken boy who suffered so much and suffered more and more and yet he still remained whole and good Harry Potter is possibly the most under appreciated character in his own franchise he's one of my favourite characters favourite out of the trio yet nobody gives him the respect he deserves long live the boy who lived

Remus and Tonks is also a great ship, in my opinion. I think they're cute, Tonks clearly loves Remus and doesn't care that he's a werewolf :) Remus loves her a lot, and though he screws up a little, he gets his priorities right in the end.

,harrypotter,"I know the DH epilogue attracts a lot of criticism from fans, from the lengthy 19 year timeskip, to the kids' names, to lack of information about Hogwarts post-battle or the trios' jobs, etc. The epilogue is probably the least loved chapter of the whole series, and not just because it's the last one. This post makes a case for the significance of setting the epilogue at King's Cross. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my argument boils down to Chapter 35 of DH: King's Cross. In every book ending except HBP, Dumbledore explains to Harry and readers the mysteries at work up to that point of the story. This was the last time Dumbledore reveals answers to some of the last and greatest mysteries of the series. It's worth reading these two visions of King's Cross, chapter 35 and the epilogue, against each other.  

&gt;“**I’ve got a choice**?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in **King’s** **Cross**, you say? I think that **if you decided not to go back, you would be able to** ... let’s say ... **board a train**.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“And where would it take me?”  
&gt;  
&gt;""On,"" said Dumbledore simply. 

This is Harry's final choice of the series, taking place after he has chosen to walk freely to his own death. This is the cross roads chapter, making the epilogue a resolution to this moment. The epilogue answers the question of where Harry's life took him in his choice to go back (let's call it the train not chosen): a life where he has a family and children to send off to their own adventures. As cheesy as it is to say, because of Harry's choice not to board a train at this otherworldly King's Cross, his kids can board a train to go to Hogwarts. Whereas the journey to King's Cross occurs towards the beginning of the other 6 books, before the year's escapades at Hogwarts can start, this time we end at King's Cross where a new adventure for a new generation is bound to begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But **you want me to go back**?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I think,"" said Dumbledore, ""that **if you choose to return**, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love**. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. **If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye** for the present.""

In the King's Cross limbo, Harry's first reaction is to ask if Dumbledore wants him to go back; he hasn't expressed the desire to return himself. Dumbledore plainly states Harry's life's goal, ""you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart,"" which is what the epilogue fulfills in showing us the Weasley-Granger-Potter family and a host of innocent children. Instead of families ""torn apart"" we see families formed (there's even a hint of Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley getting together). There was a nod to Draco Malfoy, as the poster child of un-maimed souls (it was his soul that Dumbledore and Snape schemed to protect). 

I think it's important that Harry's first reaction when facing the choice to return is to glance at the flayed child form of Voldemort. Here's how it was described earlier:

&gt;It had the form of **a small, naked child,** curled on the ground, **its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted**, stuffed out of sight, **struggling for breath**.

Voldemort had maimed his soul in order to tether his soul to life and avoid death. The name he created himself means ""flight from death,"" and this moment reveals where Voldemort's efforts have truly gotten him. Here we have the form of the most pitiable figure imaginable: ""flayed...shuddering...unwanted...struggling for breath."" It is Voldemort Dumbledore refers to when he tells Harry to ""pity the living, and above all, those who live without love."" Voldemort alone is stuck in the expanse of this mysterious in-between area. Dumbledore and Harry both leave this place because the living and the dead are able to move ""on"" in a way that Voldemort has refused to. 

In contrast with the child form of Voldemort in King's Cross, the epilogue is populated by actual children. Voldemort had damaged himself so immensely that his child form had been mutilated and suffering as a result of his actions. Harry's children bear names of the dead who, memorialized, live on in a way that Voldemort didn't all because Harry valued love. Harry moves on to a future, a life of love, which is the key difference that separates him from Voldemort.

&amp;#x200B;

The epilogue shows a lot growth in Harry compared to the young adult we saw in the King's Cross of Chapter 35. At that time, it was still Dumbledore who held all the answers and needed to answer Harry's many questions, but in the King's Cross in the epilogue, Harry has taken up Dumbledore's role of explaining and reassuring. In his role as a dad, Harry resembles Dumbledore as Harry knew him; there are echoes of his relationship to Dumbledore in his relationships with his own kids. Like Dumbledore, he's rather indulgent. He advises Albus not to let his brother rile him up, but doesn't seem too concerned about James' teasing (""he likes a laugh, your brother""). He comforts Lily, promising, “It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too.” And he tells Albus not to worry about sorting into Slytherin, revealing a secret knowledge to him alone: ""if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."" 

Harry is understated in the epilogue. People still stare at him, but his own children and niece/nephew don't seem to know why he's famous. Harry has never enjoyed his own limelight, but this ending, where there is no hint any of Harry's heroics or accomplishments, highlights the ways that Harry is fundamentally unlike the Voldemort left behind at King's Cross in chapter 35. The fact that Harry's tale as the Boy who Lived is somewhat irrelevant here (it doesn't matter to the children, who are concerned with their own Hogwarts' journeys), pushes Voldemort further into obscurity. Harry is here as a father and uncle, not as the hero of the Wizarding World or a powerful, legendary wizard. The epilogue continues Harry's story as a journey of love. The flayed figure was under a seat, ""unwanted,"" while Harry is surrounded by loved ones. It was Voldemort who clung to permanence and stagnancy. Harry, who is shown moving on as life changes, is living with love and watching his own son's ""excitement"" as his son leaves on the train. Thematically, the epilogue brought a lot of book themes full circle, even it it frustrated people in its overly-sentimental conclusion.

&gt;The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. **Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him**. ...",t2_fsolngy,False,,0,False,Epilogue at King's Cross - The Significance of HP's Ending Location,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_lzd48x,False,dark,0.98,,public,74,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,74,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615099505.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know the DH epilogue attracts a lot of criticism from fans, from the lengthy 19 year timeskip, to the kids&amp;#39; names, to lack of information about Hogwarts post-battle or the trios&amp;#39; jobs, etc. The epilogue is probably the least loved chapter of the whole series, and not just because it&amp;#39;s the last one.

,harrypotter,"Pensieves and other magical means of telling the truth highlight one of the big weaknesses in Rowling's writing; she tends to invent these things that are very interesting for the book they're introduced in, but she doesn't take into consideration the impact said item might have on the future stories or the ones already out if they're something that, by virtue of what it can do, can break an entire storyline.

Pensieves are one such example of this, and it really shows at the end of *Goblet of Fire*.  As I believe u/JulianApostat has brought up, the fact that there are surefire ways in the Wizarding world to confirm if someone is  lying or not should have major implications for how the justice system works in the wizarding world, but whenever a trial comes up, no one even thinks  about it.   

And more importantly, there are many times throughout the books where some important events happen with either no witnesses, or the only witnesses are kids (typically Harry) and afterwards no one believes them. This is the sort of situation where the adults should look at Harry's memories of the events in question, or if still in doubt, use a Time Turner to send back an invisible observer.

A good example of this is at the end of *Goblet of Fire*, after Barty Crouch Jr. gets kissed by the Dementor that Fudge brought with him. Fudge is refusing to believe Voldemort has returned.     Everyone's like  ""Omigod, Fudge just fed the very important witness to  a Dementor, and now we have no way to prove the truth!"" Yet the  confession of Crouch Jr. is recorded in the memories of four people  along with, in one case, the very events in question. All Dumbledore has to do is make a quick dash  for the Pensieve, and suddenly Fudge is faced not with an  unsubstantiated allegation, but with irrefutable proof that  is far harder to reject without looking like a coward.   The Pensieve of Harry's memories would be very useful here, because as dense as Fudge may be, he would have a hard time claiming that Harry simply imagined the whole scene down to the very last  detail, like the real-life cemetery he'd never been to, something easily  verifiable, since Dumbledore knows of Riddle's origins. (And before anyone uses that bullshit ""memories can be altered"" argument, let me remind you that  Pensieve tampering is *really really easy to spot*. It's blatantly visible even to the naked eye of an untrained observer, such as Harry.    And that was with Slughorn, an Occlumens skilled enough to block out Dumbledore mentally)  

 That and/or they could have just used the very convenient Time Turners  introduced in the previous book to just go back in time under an Invisibility Cloak to witness the events at the  cemetery. Even if Fudge  didn't want to, it beggars belief to think that Dumbledore wouldn't be  able to prove it.   Dumbledore at this time holds a lot of  political  influence, enough that he shouldn't be so easily outplayed by Fudge. He could've gotten Harry's story out to the press, he could've had Harry testify befor the Wizengamot as to what happened, etc, etc..

Then in *Order of the Phoenix*, a pensieve would've also come in handy at Harry's trial. Harry could have demanded to have his memories checked in a Pensieve  regarding the Dementor attack, showing irrefutable proof that there were Dementors in Little Whinging, but the thought of that never crosses his mind.  If it was explained that Fudge was obstructing all attempts for Harry to get a hearing with Pensieve viewing, it would be one thing. but clearly, in both of these cases, the real reason Pensieves, Time Turners and/or Veritaserum weren't used was because they would've broken the plot.",t2_120z5j,False,,0,False,The conundrum of Pensieves and other truth-telling methods,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_lzk4me,False,dark,0.73,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615124093.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pensieves and other magical means of telling the truth highlight one of the big weaknesses in Rowling&amp;#39;s writing; she tends to invent these things that are very interesting for the book they&amp;#39;re introduced in, but she doesn&amp;#39;t take into consideration the impact said item might have on the future stories or the ones already out if they&amp;#39;re something that, by virtue of what it can do, can break an entire storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"Once upon a time a couple months ago, yours truly thought it would be cool to see how a book would read when only reading what people shout in all caps. Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHOD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"There are two things that bother me (besides Rowling saying she now hates putting Ron and Hermione together, something that only happened after she took to the internet and discovered people hated it).

1. Voldemort isn't actually that big of a deal internationally

This is more of an insight I gained while I was listening to the audiobooks last time.

In Goblet of Fire, Cornelius Fudge is talking with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (I believe he's the Bulgarian one). He suddenly comes across Harry Potter and delightedly tells his fellow national leader “This is Harry Potter, the one who killed You-Know-Who!”

And the Bulgarian basically goes, “Interesting”. Frankly, he isn't all that uber impressed by it. When I listened to this, my eyes grew wide as a sudden realization hit me.

Voldemort was a localized threat. A national phenomenon, not world-wide. Yes, he gathered dark witches and wizards to his cause and brought in foreign aid like the giants and trolls to help him.

But he never was that big of a threat outside the UK. Maybe not even into Ireland. Why? I don't think he ever actually intended the conquest of the world.

We never know what his end goal really is. But I think he only wanted the UK, purge it of the non-desirables, and would have just sat there, nice and pretty. Or ugly in his case.

Another plot point in the story reinforced this reading of how localized Voldemort actually was.

That would be Fleur Delacour. Most people simply assume it was love that kept her in the UK when Voldemort retook power. I think it's more than that.

She is French, and yet, she doesn't fear him. Fleur lived right across the English Channel and yet she wasn't taught to fear him, because for her, as a French woman, he held no power over her.

She viewed Voldemort the same way Americans viewed Fidel Castro. An evil man, but he was so small fish that the average American had no need to even think about him, nor fear him, despite him being a very close neighbor.

It’s weird because Rowling wanted to make Voldemort some sort of worldwide threat and yet when you read of foreign characters, they seem to not even care about him.

But anyway, onto what really annoys me in this universe.

2. How magic has basically stagnated the Wizarding Community

You may be scratching your heads and saying “I don't understand.” All shall be revealed to you.

In Harry Potter 1, one of the very first things Harry learns is that the wizarding community has remained secret for the sake of the Muggles. “If they knew there was magic in the world, they would want to use it to solve every problem in their lives.” Except, that's exactly what the wizarding world does!

You never see Molly Weasley do anything without magic, besides chastising her family. She cooks, she does it with magic. Cleaning, magic. She doesn't even turn the knob on her radio by hand, instead using magic to do it.

She literally can stand, move and turn on her radio. Then again, we don't turn on TVs if we don't have to but we are talking about the wizarding world.

Harry breaks his arm during the Second Year Quidditch match when hit by a Bludger. Then Lockheart tries to fix it, instead completely making the bones disappear! What if it had been a leg? What if, heaven forbid, it was Harry's skull!

He doesn't even feel that overly bad about it. Why? Because magic! By the very next day, all Harry's bones have been regrown. In a single day and night!

You get hurt in the Wizarding world, and there is almost nothing that can't be instantly cured. Instead of being bed-ridden for weeks, you are up and about, as if nothing has happened.

In Deathly Hallows when they are setting up for a massive meal prior to the wedding of Bill and Fleur, the boys decide to get into a magical battle with all the tables and chairs. They break several pieces of furniture, yet there is no consequences besides Molly screaming at them. They don't have to go out and buy new furniture, dipping into their small banking accounts.

Why? Because magic instantly fixes all the furniture.

There is nothing learned from the experience. They aren't forced to go without a table or chairs for their reckless behavior, they don't have to spend any money on it. There is no punishment for destroying the furniture.

Magic has turned the entire society stagnant. Their most modern technology? Radios and moving photographs. Men haven't gotten to a point they wear jeans; just robes. They don't have electricity, which astonishes them so greatly that an entire class in muggle studies revolves around electricity. I think a scene from the movies describes their utterly Medieval Society.

The “rubber duck” comment. While a movie-only line, I think it was put in the movie to show how magic has put them so out the times of the world around them. They are so simplistic in their level of technology that one of the simplest things in the Muggle World is beyond their comprehension.

Let us also not think about how they literally have a tournament that they send their kids to where their chances of dying are extremely high. Their very first trial? Facing off against a dragon that their spells have little effect on. Yes, it’s only meant for 6th Years on up, but this was only after they revised the rules because too many kids were being killed in it.

It’s like magic completely made them irresponsible as adults and guardians for the very kids they are supposed to be protecting.

Magic is very important to the wizarding world…..but perhaps it is too important to them.

,harrypotter,"Voldemort is vanquished for the first time in 1981, as we know, and does not truly reappear in any meaningful way until 1991.

My questions are as follows:

1. What was he doing during this time? I saw an old post that said: ""Voldemort was living off of rats and snakes. Inhabiting their bodies long enough to survive before moving on. We know he had some magical abilities at that point, but they were severely limited on his host body."" Is this mentioned in the books? How weak of a condition was he in, magically speaking?

Without the help of Quirrell or any of his other followers, would he have remained in that weakened condition in the Albanian Forest permanently?

2. Did most of his former followers believe him to be permanently gone? IIRC the only people who believed he would come back were Dumbledore, Snape, Barty Crouch Jr, and Bellatrix - am I wrong?

3. Did any of his former Death Eaters (even ones like Malfoy) hold ANY level of genuine regret over their actions, even if they still believed in 'the cause?'

4. Getting to the Prophecy, was it inevitable? What I mean is, was it 'destined', if you will, that Voldemort would return and be defeated by Harry? Or did Voldemort himself set the Prophecy into motion by going after Harry in the first place? For example...Say he disregarded the Prophecy, and didn't go after the Potters....What then? Would Harry still have grown up to be able to challenge him some other way? I'm curious about what the books (I haven't read them in a LONG time) or Rowling has said about the role Destiny or Fate played in it.

5. A controversial question....I know as a young man Dumbledore had a bit of ""prejudice"" shall we say against Muggles, and that is in part what initially made him join with Grindlewald in their idea of a ""pure"" world. Would a younger, pre-Arianna's death Albus have joined Voldemort? Or was he too strong minded to be a follower?

,harrypotter,"Hi all,

First post here, but I just started re-reading the series for like the 4th or 5th time tonight. As I read Chapter 1 of the first book, I realized a kind of random and funny observation I’ve always been curious about. 

In the section where Vernon Dursley is heading home from work and he bumps into someone, does anyone remember if we’re ever told explicitly who that is? I realize that’s a super small detail, but for me personally I’ve always imagined it as Professor Flitwick  (at least from my second read through on, I obviously didn’t think of it in my first read.) 

My main reason why is because the individual is described as “a tiny old man wearing a violet cloak” having “ a squeaky voice that made passerby stare” and also as “hugging Mr. Dursley around the waist”. Essentially, a very short, older wizard with a squeaky voice and violet cloak. To me, it matches the film adaptation of Flitwick in the first movie almost perfectly, which has always made me wonder.",t2_9lg474kp,False,,0,False,Sorcerer’s/Philosopher’s Stone - Chapter 1,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_lzgcjw,False,dark,0.71,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615110184.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"And I don't think Ravenclaw is the house that suits her best, either. I think this will get long since I've found a good amount of stuff in the books to support the claim that Hermione's personality is very much Slytherin in a lot of ways. The only thing that prevented her from being sorted into it is her muggle heritage and the only reason muggleborns are not sorted into Slytherin is plot convenience to make Slytherin the evil house full of pureblood supremacists and have a defined group of antagonists in Hogwarts.

Let's look at the traits associated with each house.


Gryffindor: courage, bravery, determination, daring, nerve, chivalry

Hermione does things that indeed require a good amount of courage and bravery, but not without planning things before hand. She is very *resourceful* and focused on damage reduction, one could say *self-preserving* when doing something 

She is determined, which is also a Slytherin trait and has great *ambitions*

I'm unsure about the daring part. Hermione is willing to take risks to some extent, but as I said always focused on damage reduction.

Nerve is were it gets off. Sure, if you use it as a  synonym for courage it would still be fitting, but I rather interpret it as bold so I don't have 3 traits that basically come down to the same thing. Hermione is usually more subtle when she acts, though.

Chivalry and Hermione don't go well together at all. I've spent a good amount of time checking definitions of chivalry and it all boils down to honor and nobility in addition to 10 historical rules about defending the church. The issue is that Hermione does not fight fair or honorable. Stealing ingredients to make poly juice potion and spy on others is not honorable or noble. Attacking someone with magical birds out of jealousy is not noble. Making people sign a list without telling them it is hexed is not noble.


Hufflepuff: hard-working, patience, fairness, just, loyalty, modesty

Hard-working checks out, it very much alignes with the *determination* and *ambition* mentioned earlier.

Hermione is not necessarily patient. Sure, she rather takes longer to do something when this means the odds of succeeding are higher that way, but generally she is not patient. She acts rather annoyed when things take to long for her liking or others don't understand things she considers rather obvious.

I already mentioned that Hermione doesn't really fight fair. Of course you can argue that the ends justify the means, but that doesn't change anything about this.

Hermione has a strong sense of justice and morals, but what she considers to be just is basically what allignes with her personal agenda. If something doesn't fit her point of view she barely listens to the other person for example when Ron came back in DH or when she participated in bullying Fleur at the Burrow in HBP.

Hermione is loyal to her friends, unless she attacks them with magical birds because her feelings are hurt. 

Modesty is also not Hermione's strength. Sure, she doesn't gloat about always coming out on top of her class but her know-it-all attitude is not really modest.


Ravenclaw: wit, learning, wisdom, acceptance, intelligence, creativity

Wit, learning, wisdom and intelligence match perfectly, after all Hermione is supposed to be the brains of the group. This is also the reason many people say she should have been in Ravenclaw. 

Acceptance is one of this aspects that partially fit as long as certain conditions are met. Hermione is accepting, especially of people and magical beings that are discriminated against in the wizarding society. However, she is not accepting of different points of view or certain people who intend no harm (Fleur, Luna, Trewlawney). As soon as something doesn't fit her narrative the acceptance stops.

Creativity is also not her strength. She religiously sticks to what is written in the books. For example she saw that the altered recipes in the book of the HBP worked better than the ones in the book, but instead of investigating them she instantly refused to accept anything that is related to the book.


Slytherin: resourcefulness, determination, pride, cunning, ambition, self-preservation

Resourcefulness is one of Hermione's strengths. She is a quick thinker and able to make detailed plans to achieve her goals. The part where she led Umbridge to the forest in OotP is a good example for this.

Determination and ambition are also very prominent traits of her. When she has a goal she focuses on reaching it and works incredibly hard for it. She has the ambition to make magical Britain a better places for everyone, S.P.E.W. is a perfect example for this. Despite everyone telling her it's stupid she continued to work on it.

Hermione is very prideful, her attacking Ron out of jealousy is a perfect example for this. Her pride was hurt by him making out with Lavender.

Hermione is one of the most cunning characters in the entire series. The DA's list in OotP, the poly juice potion in CoS, setting Snape on fire in PS, catching Rita Skeeter in the jar in GoF and blackmailing her or confunding McLaggen in HBP are just some examples.

Self-preservation is not as obvious, but Hermione doesn't act reckless. She is usually very much aware of what she can get away with and acts accordingly.

So, this was only going through the lists of traits associated with each house, but there is more.

In PS the sorting hat sings:

 *those cunning folks use any means to achieve their ends*

This is basically Hermione. She has good intentions, but the way she tries to get to her goal are often not that honorable. This is not really shown to the reader, because Hermione usually proven right in what she does, even if it is objectively shitty behavior. Confunding McLaggen so that Ron makes the cut for the team? He turns out to be a massive douche later on. Letting Crookshanks hunt Scabbers? Scabbers turns out to be an evil wizard. Hating the HBP's book? There is dark magic written in it. Hexing the DA's list to **permanently** disfigure a potential snitch? Marietta rats them out.

Hermione only sticks to the rules when they don't interfere with her own agenda. When they don't she doesn't care for them.

,harrypotter,"Hi Potterheads!

I have a question for you. What informations are wizarding children (not muggle raised) expected to have before starting Hogwarts?

Common plants used in Herbology and their care? Common potion ingredients, their use and conservation, the basic techniques and the tool used in potion making? The basic of using a wand and a broom and their maintenance? Basic history of magic?

Or even the most basics informations were given the first weeks to get all the children to start on the same level?

I'm planning a Pre-Hogwarts education story so I'll appreciate your feedback!

,harrypotter,"So I'm in the middle of a re-read of the series, and I've had something of an epiphany.

It's already been established that Harry couldn't see the thestrals before witnessing Cedric's death, even though he was present for Lily's murder. This was because although Harry \*technically\* saw death, he was too young to really understand what he'd seen and internalize it. In order for someone to see a thestral, they need to really *know* that they've seen death in order for the change to take place. Since Harry was exactly 15 months old at the time, he certainly didn't know what the heck was going on.

And yet, as we see in POA, Harry certainly appears to have a vivid recollection of that fateful Halloween night. Well, at least he seems to remember the words that were spoken, as well as the flash of green light of the curse. In fact, Harry's recollection of the conversation is really quite remarkable for a 15-month-old child. He remembers everything that James, Lily, and Voldemort said, word-for-word - even words that a child his age probably wouldn't know yet. He doesn't just remember tones, snatches of words, or garbled sounds - he remembers the whole conversation with perfect clarity.

How is this possible? I don't think it is.

I believe that the ""memory"" Harry experiences in POA whenever the dementors approach him is actually the memory of the Horcrux within him. That is to say, this is really the memory that Voldemort has of that fateful night. Since the Harry-Horcrux was made that very night, that memory would be fresh in the ""mind"" of that bit of Voldemort's soul. 

Before Harry understands what's happening in that memory, he seems to be reacting to it as an outsider, and is distressed that a woman is about to be killed. He put the pieces together and figured out that the woman screaming was, in fact, his own mother. But he didn't recognize that memory as his own - probably because it wasn't really his own memory. Prior to his first dementor encounter, Harry's only memory of that night was just a flash of green light, which would make sense, because he was only 15 months old.

When the dementors first encountered Harry, they probably recognized that Harry had a bit more soul than the average person, and began to try and ""eat"" that piece of soul, finding it irresistible. Once the dementors first touched that Horcrux soul-piece within Harry, I think that's when the connection between Harry, the Horcrux, and Voldemort was ""activated."" All of a sudden, Harry is able to remember something he shouldn't really be able to remember. It just so happens that this memory is the last thing the Voldemort soul piece would have remembered. And less than a year later, Harry began having strange visions involving Voldemort, seemingly happening in real time.

&lt;p&gt;Before Harry understands what&amp;#39;s happening in that memory, he seems to be reacting to it as an outsider, and is distressed that a woman is about to be killed. He put the pieces together and figured out that the woman screaming was, in fact, his own mother. But he didn&amp;#39;t recognize that memory as his own - probably because it wasn&amp;#39;t really his own memory. Prior to his first dementor encounter, Harry&amp;#39;s only memory of that night was just a flash of green light, which would make sense, because he was only 15 months old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the dementors first encountered Harry, they probably recognized that Harry had a bit more soul than the average person, and began to try and &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; that piece of soul, finding it irresistible. Once the dementors first touched that Horcrux soul-piece within Harry, I think that&amp;#39;s when the connection between Harry, the Horcrux, and Voldemort was &amp;quot;activated.&amp;quot; All of a sudden, Harry is able to remember something he shouldn&amp;#39;t really be able to remember. It just so happens that this memory is the last thing the Voldemort soul piece would have remembered. And less than a year later, Harry began having strange visions involving Voldemort, seemingly happening in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidence? I think not!&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"Last summer, I did an experiment where I listened to the books all at the same time in chapter order. So, I'd read all chapters one in order, then all chapters 2 in order, and so on. It was mostly to try the series out in a new way as I've probably read each book once a year since each came out.

One major takeaway: it was interesting to see the growth of the characters as the series develops and the shift in tone. I assumed that the characters would get darker and the tone as well. Actually, in many ways, especially in the last three books, there's more humor than you would expect. The books get more concrete in the use of magic, as well. The latter books deal with how magic functions and less just a whimsical world full of quirky notes of wonder. It never gets as concrete or analytical as I would like, but that's just my taste.

It was also interesting to see how the first two chapters or so were vastly different. In the first three books, there's a heavier emphasis on readers who have never read the books, including in the second and third book a ""this is Harry Potter, a wizard who goes to Hogwarts, a school of magic"" whereas the next books don't even start with Harry at all or start with him without any prelude and just assume the reader is experienced. The amount of time we spend with him at the Dursleys varies quite a bit in each book.

What I had hoped was to see a lot of those connections develop over the story by layering it on top of itself. Instead, it seems more like a bunch of disparate interesting ideas that sometimes connect when convenient but don't always work well together. There are tonal and world inconsistencies galore. As with many building stories (I'm looking at you, Supernatural), some of the worldbuilding gets outright retconned if it doesn't fit the needs of the story in the moment. Magic is a means of telling a story and the world gets less realistic but more interesting as it builds out. That's a much more obvious flaw when looking at all of the chapters together and seeing how the world is depicted. It doesn't scale well, though I prefer the larger, more diverse world of the later books to the more insular, smaller world of the first few books.

It's also glaringly obvious that the fourth book is the bridge. There is one world in the first three books and a different world in the last three books. It's why I think the fourth is so divisive. It has to connect worlds that really don't work well together (the first three books develop a Hogwarts that is too small to support the world of the last three books). 

Anyway, I'd recommend giving this a try.

It never gets as concrete or analytical as I would like, but that&amp;#39;s just my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also interesting to see how the first two chapters or so were vastly different. In the first three books, there&amp;#39;s a heavier emphasis on readers who have never read the books, including in the second and third book a &amp;quot;this is Harry Potter, a wizard who goes to Hogwarts, a school of magic&amp;quot; whereas the next books don&amp;#39;t even start with Harry at all or start with him without any prelude and just assume the reader is experienced. The amount of time we spend with him at the Dursleys varies quite a bit in each book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I had hoped was to see a lot of those connections develop over the story by layering it on top of itself. Instead, it seems more like a bunch of disparate interesting ideas that sometimes connect when convenient but don&amp;#39;t always work well together. There are tonal and world inconsistencies galore. As with many building stories (I&amp;#39;m looking at you, Supernatural), some of the worldbuilding gets outright retconned if it doesn&amp;#39;t fit the needs of the story in the moment. Magic is a means of telling a story and the world gets less realistic but more interesting as it builds out. That&amp;#39;s a much more obvious flaw when looking at all of the chapters together and seeing how the world is depicted. It doesn&amp;#39;t scale well, though I prefer the larger, more diverse world of the later books to the more insular, smaller world of the first few books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also glaringly obvious that the fourth book is the bridge. There is one world in the first three books and a different world in the last three books. It&amp;#39;s why I think the fourth is so divisive. It has to connect worlds that really don&amp;#39;t work well together (the first three books develop a Hogwarts that is too small to support the world of the last three books). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;d recommend giving this a try. It changed my understanding of the series for good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"There are so many great Ron Weasley moments. My favorite moment is the chess match.

Maybe it's a basic favorite, but it really showcases Ron's personality. We learn how strategic his is when he beats the chess set. We can see him be confident for once, and know that this is an area that nobody overshadows him in.

We also see Ron's selflessness. He was willing to sacrifice himself for not only his friends, but the fate of the wizarding world.

“Yes. . .” said Ron softly, “it's the only way . . . I've got to be taken.”

“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.

“That's chess!” snapped Ron. “You've got to make some sacrifices! I'll make my move and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”

“But —”

“Do you want Snape or not?”

“Ron —”

“Look, if you don't hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”

There was nothing else for it.

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now don't hang around once you've won.”

He stepped forward and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard around the head with her stone ark and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.”

I like this scene the most because this kid is only eleven, and he's doing things adults would never do! All three got chances to prove themselves in that chapter, but Ron's was by far the best.

Anyone who says Ron is a coward, or not good enough for the trio needs to read the same books I did.


Honorable mentions include:

Any funny remark that cheers Harry up. (including calling him on the “fellytone""

When he stands up on one foot to tell Sirius that he'll have to kill him before Harry.

When he is the one brave enough to apologize to Harry in the Goblet of Fire.

When he returns in the Deathly Hallows.

When the “Weasley is Our King"" song is turned into a Gryffindor version.

When he first kisses Hermione

When he first meets Harry

And lastly, when he tells Harry that he'll be there to support him the whole time at the end of the Half Blood Prince.

I could go on and on about how much Ron has done for his friends. I don't get how people can sit there and bash him.

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing else for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now don&amp;#39;t hang around once you&amp;#39;ve won.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stepped forward and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard around the head with her stone ark and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he&amp;#39;d been knocked out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this scene the most because this kid is only eleven, and he&amp;#39;s doing things adults would never do! All three got chances to prove themselves in that chapter, but Ron&amp;#39;s was by far the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who says Ron is a coward, or not good enough for the trio needs to read the same books I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honorable mentions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any funny remark that cheers Harry up. (including calling him on the “fellytone&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he stands up on one foot to tell Sirius that he&amp;#39;ll have to kill him before Harry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he is the one brave enough to apologize to Harry in the Goblet of Fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he returns in the Deathly Hallows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the “Weasley is Our King&amp;quot; song is turned into a Gryffindor version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he first kisses Hermione&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he first meets Harry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, when he tells Harry that he&amp;#39;ll be there to support him the whole time at the end of the Half Blood Prince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about how much Ron has done for his friends. I don&amp;#39;t get how people can sit there and bash him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron is arguably the most underrated character in Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"This might be over done (barely use this sub reddit so I won't know) but I want to know your opinions

Who would win in a duel between the chosen one's best friends, Hermione vs Ron, duel starts with them facing each other 5 m apart with no other weapons wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

Most people I knew are Hermione fans but turns out a lot of people on the internet like Ron so this thread might go either way

Personally I believe Ron would win, I've said it before, knowledge vs power, Hermione might know more spells and can use non-verbal curses. But I believe Ron has better feats in actual fights, most people who support Hermione usually talk about how she saved the trio multiple times and is insanely smart, but Hermione saving the duo never included beating anyone in a duel.

But Ron has pretty impressive battle feats, like fighting multiple death eaters in the ministry (Luna said ""them"" so I can infer he fought multiple DE and won or tied since we don't see other death eaters come out the door) hit a wasp mid air and protected Tonks from Bellatrix and Rudolphus in mid air (Tonks even commended him) In the manor he also did well against Narcissa, Draco and being able to disarm Bellatrix. He also fought five snatchers of (possibly could have been three since two were apparently fighting each other when he fought back) and he reacted faster then Hermione in the cafe and saved her, she would have been taken out of the fight immediately if not for him. (This also proves is definitely faster then the two of them) i also want to point out that he did perform that slug spell verblessly, Ron also is physically fitter, which is helpful for dodging or just being able to close the gap and punch her. Hermione did fight Bellatrix but she had Ginny and Luna with her (who are both rather talented) and they still were losing. If the two fought I feel Ron would fire faster before Hermione could do any proper spell.

But I believe Ron has better feats in actual fights, most people who support Hermione usually talk about how she saved the trio multiple times and is insanely smart, but Hermione saving the duo never included beating anyone in a duel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ron has pretty impressive battle feats, like fighting multiple death eaters in the ministry (Luna said &amp;quot;them&amp;quot; so I can infer he fought multiple DE and won or tied since we don&amp;#39;t see other death eaters come out the door) hit a wasp mid air and protected Tonks from Bellatrix and Rudolphus in mid air (Tonks even commended him) In the manor he also did well against Narcissa, Draco and being able to disarm Bellatrix. He also fought five snatchers of (possibly could have been three since two were apparently fighting each other when he fought back) and he reacted faster then Hermione in the cafe and saved her, she would have been taken out of the fight immediately if not for him. (This also proves is definitely faster then the two of them) i also want to point out that he did perform that slug spell verblessly, Ron also is physically fitter, which is helpful for dodging or just being able to close the gap and punch her. Hermione did fight Bellatrix but she had Ginny and Luna with her (who are both rather talented) and they still were losing. If the two fought I feel Ron would fire faster before Hermione could do any proper spell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

Summary: At first, Malfoy's twin named Margaret dislikes Harry as much as her brother does. Over time, however, tho she develops and Draco begins to see that his sister is developing a love/hate relationship with Potter that slowly shifts to more love than hate. Feelings are mutual. There will be some character death however nothing too large. This is my first pic so please be sure to leave suggestions down below.

,harrypotter,"For all the turd thrown JK Rowling's way about how horrible Voldemort is as a villain, I maintain that Albus Dumbledore is one of the most brilliantly written villains in all of fantasy fiction.

Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows really showed how much of a villainous monster Albus Dumbledore really was...

First, Order of the Phoenix:

From:

&gt;*“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”*

To...

&gt;*“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I don’t —”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined — not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.”*

To quote and paraphrase an awesome HP fanfic author summarizing Dumbledore's ""love"" for Harry in order to send him off to be a pig for slaughter. What Dumbledore essentially said was:

***“I concealed things from you because I loved you so much, and your innocent face just made me decide to lie and lie and lie to you. And you should be so grateful your aunt took you in and abused you for ten years, because at least you aren’t dead. And don’t you feel so guilty that people might have died because I loved you so much that I had to lie to you.”***

There also seems to be this desperate attempt to make Adolf Dumbledore - oh sorry, *Albus* Dumbledore - seem like some innocent hero doing horrible things to Harry because he cared. Are we really expected to believe that he cared? Cared so much that he didn't tell Harry the truth until after the only obstacle that could free Harry from his abusive relatives was 100% dead, he was head of the Wizengamot for years and apparently he felt nothing about Sirius Black being sent to prison without a trial nor opened-up any investigation for 13 years on a man being sent off to prison without due process, and *conveniently* Sirius Black happens to be free of all charges after his death once Dumbledore regains his status on the Wizengamot despite there still being no proof that Peter Pettigrew was alive. Dumbledore just conveniently gains the power to get Sirius's name cleared, so why not do it after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban? Because then, he'd lose the pawn needed to sacrifice himself for Dumbledore's Greater Good, of course.

It's quite clear that Dumbledore thinks himself infallible and all his plans to be infallible too. His arrogance is attested to in Half-blood Prince and Deathly Hallows:

&gt;“\[. . .\] being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” (Book 6, U.S. p. 197)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.” (Book 6, U.S. p. 570)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“And at last, my brother \[Albus\] had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was.” (Book 7, U.S. p. 566)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.” (Book 7, U.S. p. 716)

How humble! He seemed to think his flaws were loving too much, but I'd argue that it was his sheer arrogance. This man really seemed to think that he was infallible. Nowhere is this more clear than with Horcrux hunting; the level of stupidity in Dumbledore's plans is hilarious. First, in Order of the Phoenix, while mocking Sirius for not valuing his house elf Kreacher enough, right after Sirius's death no less!, Dumbledore makes a point saying how Wizards often underestimate the House-elves and overlook them. That's nice; too bad he does exactly that with Kreacher, no less! Presumably, he spent so many months researching the cave that Harry and he go to in Half-blood Prince, while paying no attention to Mundungus Fletcher's pilfering of 12 Grimmauld Place, which results in the very Horcrux Dumbledore sought to obtain enter into Dolores Umbridge's hands! The sheer incompetence is hilarious, yet the narrative and Dumbledore himself has you convinced that Dumbledore isn't a colossal idiot.

Let's talk about the other brilliant plan from Albus Dumbledore: Doing absolutely nothing to stop Draco Malfoy, resulting in Death Eaters like the Carrows, Greyback, and *Bellatrix fucking Lestrange entering Hogwarts and killing children.* What a brilliant move on almighty, infallible, goody-good guy Dumbledore! He cared for Draco's wellbeing so much that he let children die so he could potentially recruit another spy for his Order of the Phoenix! The same Order of the Phoenix that had a member illegally sell Black family heirlooms *and* a Horcrux. All because in the beginning of Book 6, Dumbledore convinced Harry Potter that it was for the ""Greater Good"" to let the Order of the Phoenix use Grimmauld Place.

Oh! Oh! Let's get to the *stupidest part* of Mr. Infallible's plans. He shows Harry a memory convincing Harry that a Horcrux is within the halls of Hogwarts hidden somewhere -- as if there's a Room of Hidden Things where they could find it -- and *does absolutely nothing to find the Horcrux that is within the Castle while taking a trip to a far off mountain with Harry to urgently find another Horcrux.* Apparently, Horcrux hunting is only urgent if it is outside of Hogwarts castle. Dumbledore and Harry are lucky that a Death Eater like Bellatrix didn't spot it, recognize it, and take it to return to Lord Voldemort since we know she knew about them and had one in the Lestrange vault.

But wait! It gets dumber and dumber! If Voldemort had simply cast the killing curse on Severus Snape in Book 7, then Dumbledore's harebrained schemes would have fallen apart and Harry wouldn't have known to sacrifice himself. And, by the way, Dumbledore postulating that Harry could come back - as some have claimed his ""look of triumph"" in book 4, Goblet of Fire, somehow implies despite it being so vague as to mean anything - the fact is that he had no way of knowing if Harry would survive or not. It never was tested before and at best, he could only speculate. So, no, he didn't send Harry ""knowing he'd survive"" as [some people fool themselves into believing](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/fxs61w/fans_who_hate_dumbledore_for_raising_harry_like_a/), he sent Harry without knowing what the consequences would be and being perfectly fine with the result of Harry dying for the Greater Good that he concocted in his head. Evidently, Harry Potter dying for the ""greater good"" is fine, but stopping Draco Malfoy before he brings Death Eaters to kill children isn't part of Dumbledore's ""greater good"" at all. People obsessed with ""proving"" that ""[Dumbledore loved Harry!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3m7bji/just_want_opinion_of_fans_did_dumbledore_ever/cvcn43t/)"" are hilarious. Where was the love for Harry in Snape's memory in Book 7? He MOCKS Snape *specifically for having any compassion for Harry*. Is that love?

It is hilarious that people go on and on with mental gymnastics trying to pretend Albus Dumbledore was ever a good person. When shown a Tom Riddle living in an orphanage with a not-so-nice upbringing, he failed to do anything and actually *took the advice of an 11-year old Tom Marvolo Riddle* to let the kid wander to the Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley alone. Dumbledore's negligent behavior that puts children in danger extends as far back as at least that, even if we discount that he got his own sister murdered through his incompetence -- assuming he didn't kill her himself since he seems to like blaming everything on Grindelwald and scapegoating him while presenting himself as a blameless victim who was too ""in love"" and ""blinded"" by it. And notice this, he *immediately* believes Tom Riddle is evil at age 11. Only a true villain could project his own failings onto a child and say the child therefore born evil. Albus Dumbledore is one of the greatest villains and incompetent Headmasters in all of fantasy fiction.

First, in Order of the Phoenix, while mocking Sirius for not valuing his house elf Kreacher enough, right after Sirius&amp;#39;s death no less!, Dumbledore makes a point saying how Wizards often underestimate the House-elves and overlook them. That&amp;#39;s nice; too bad he does exactly that with Kreacher, no less! Presumably, he spent so many months researching the cave that Harry and he go to in Half-blood Prince, while paying no attention to Mundungus Fletcher&amp;#39;s pilfering of 12 Grimmauld Place, which results in the very Horcrux Dumbledore sought to obtain enter into Dolores Umbridge&amp;#39;s hands! The sheer incompetence is hilarious, yet the narrative and Dumbledore himself has you convinced that Dumbledore isn&amp;#39;t a colossal idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about the other brilliant plan from Albus Dumbledore: Doing absolutely nothing to stop Draco Malfoy, resulting in Death Eaters like the Carrows, Greyback, and &lt;em&gt;Bellatrix fucking Lestrange entering Hogwarts and killing children.&lt;/em&gt; What a brilliant move on almighty, infallible, goody-good guy Dumbledore! He cared for Draco&amp;#39;s wellbeing so much that he let children die so he could potentially recruit another spy for his Order of the Phoenix! The same Order of the Phoenix that had a member illegally sell Black family heirlooms &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a Horcrux. All because in the beginning of Book 6, Dumbledore convinced Harry Potter that it was for the &amp;quot;Greater Good&amp;quot; to let the Order of the Phoenix use Grimmauld Place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! Oh! Let&amp;#39;s get to the &lt;em&gt;stupidest part&lt;/em&gt; of Mr. Infallible&amp;#39;s plans. He shows Harry a memory convincing Harry that a Horcrux is within the halls of Hogwarts hidden somewhere -- as if there&amp;#39;s a Room of Hidden Things where they could find it -- and &lt;em&gt;does absolutely nothing to find the Horcrux that is within the Castle while taking a trip to a far off mountain with Harry to urgently find another Horcrux.&lt;/em&gt; Apparently, Horcrux hunting is only urgent if it is outside of Hogwarts castle. Dumbledore and Harry are lucky that a Death Eater like Bellatrix didn&amp;#39;t spot it, recognize it, and take it to return to Lord Voldemort since we know she knew about them and had one in the Lestrange vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! It gets dumber and dumber! If Voldemort had simply cast the killing curse on Severus Snape in Book 7, then Dumbledore&amp;#39;s harebrained schemes would have fallen apart and Harry wouldn&amp;#39;t have known to sacrifice himself. And, by the way, Dumbledore postulating that Harry could come back - as some have claimed his &amp;quot;look of triumph&amp;quot; in book 4, Goblet of Fire, somehow implies despite it being so vague as to mean anything - the fact is that he had no way of knowing if Harry would survive or not. It never was tested before and at best, he could only speculate. So, no, he didn&amp;#39;t send Harry &amp;quot;knowing he&amp;#39;d survive&amp;quot; as &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/fxs61w/fans_who_hate_dumbledore_for_raising_harry_like_a/""&gt;some people fool themselves into believing&lt;/a&gt;, he sent Harry without knowing what the consequences would be and being perfectly fine with the result of Harry dying for the Greater Good that he concocted in his head. Evidently, Harry Potter dying for the &amp;quot;greater good&amp;quot; is fine, but stopping Draco Malfoy before he brings Death Eaters to kill children isn&amp;#39;t part of Dumbledore&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;greater good&amp;quot; at all. People obsessed with &amp;quot;proving&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3m7bji/just_want_opinion_of_fans_did_dumbledore_ever/cvcn43t/""&gt;Dumbledore loved Harry!!!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; are hilarious. Where was the love for Harry in Snape&amp;#39;s memory in Book 7? He MOCKS Snape &lt;em&gt;specifically for having any compassion for Harry&lt;/em&gt;. Is that love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hilarious that people go on and on with mental gymnastics trying to pretend Albus Dumbledore was ever a good person. When shown a Tom Riddle living in an orphanage with a not-so-nice upbringing, he failed to do anything and actually &lt;em&gt;took the advice of an 11-year old Tom Marvolo Riddle&lt;/em&gt; to let the kid wander to the Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley alone. Dumbledore&amp;#39;s negligent behavior that puts children in danger extends as far back as at least that, even if we discount that he got his own sister murdered through his incompetence -- assuming he didn&amp;#39;t kill her himself since he seems to like blaming everything on Grindelwald and scapegoating him while presenting himself as a blameless victim who was too &amp;quot;in love&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;blinded&amp;quot; by it. And notice this, he &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; believes Tom Riddle is evil at age 11. Only a true villain could project his own failings onto a child and say the child therefore born evil. Albus Dumbledore is one of the greatest villains and incompetent Headmasters in all of fantasy fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"So most consider the names cringe-worthy, and granted Harry had no lack of brilliant people he could of honoured who sacrificed everything but I think the names he chose are beautiful.

So starting with the first born, James Sirrius Potter -

James and Sirrius, two best friends, Harry's Father whom he never got to know and his Father's best friend who was as close to a Father figure as he had known. Both lived their life to the full together and would both of done anything Harry needed. A fitting name for his first born and an even fitter pairing of the two names.

Second born, Albus Severus Potter -

Albus and Severus, I think this relationship was one filled with a mutual respect and was very complex. They saw eachother at their worst and did things for one another that could only result in a bond. Albus and Harry's bond was one filled with love and admiration. Snape and Harry's bond was a complex one, some of Snape's actions towards Harry and in general are inexcusable, but Harry knows and accepts the role Snape played in the defeat of Voldermort and I think him putting Albus and Snape's name together when his relationship with the two, was so different, shows the respect and admiration Harry feels for Snape in the end and I imagine both Snape and Albus would be honoured with the pairing of their names.

Third born, Lily Luna Potter -

Again a great and worthy pairing of names.",t2_a81x0z66,False,,0,False,Unpopular opinion: Harry named his children really beautifully.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Dungbomb'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,dungbomb,0,,,False,t3_lylij4,False,dark,0.6,transparent,public,7,3,{},,62d5671e-e82f-11e7-8cda-0ec85b79a856,False,[],,False,False,,{},Dungbomb,False,7,,False,self,False,GR3,"[{'a': ':Gryff4:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/v7ck8wcm2e921_t5_2qiqi/Gryff4'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Gryffindor'}]",{},,True,,1615006113.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So most consider the names cringe-worthy, and granted Harry had no lack of brilliant people he could of honoured who sacrificed everything but I think the names he chose are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So starting with the first born, James Sirrius Potter -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James and Sirrius, two best friends, Harry&amp;#39;s Father whom he never got to know and his Father&amp;#39;s best friend who was as close to a Father figure as he had known. Both lived their life to the full together and would both of done anything Harry needed. A fitting name for his first born and an even fitter pairing of the two names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second born, Albus Severus Potter -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albus and Severus, I think this relationship was one filled with a mutual respect and was very complex. They saw eachother at their worst and did things for one another that could only result in a bond. Albus and Harry&amp;#39;s bond was one filled with love and admiration. Snape and Harry&amp;#39;s bond was a complex one, some of Snape&amp;#39;s actions towards Harry and in general are inexcusable, but Harry knows and accepts the role Snape played in the defeat of Voldermort and I think him putting Albus and Snape&amp;#39;s name together when his relationship with the two, was so different, shows the respect and admiration Harry feels for Snape in the end and I imagine both Snape and Albus would be honoured with the pairing of their names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third born, Lily Luna Potter -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lily and Luna, two completely different witches but two witches that were never afraid to speak it how it was. If they ever met, I imagine they would be great friends. Luna, like Harry had lost her mother. Luna was there for Harry in ways not even Ron or Hermione could be, this unlikely friendship was so pure. They truly would be their for eachother no matter what.

,harrypotter,"What are some parts of the Harry Potter books that you misunderstood when you read them for the first time, at a young age? Here are mine, from when I first read the books as a little kid:

1) I used to think that the reason Ginny behaved so strangely around Harry in CoS was that she was starstruck by him being a celebrity. I didn’t realize she had a crush on him.

2) I believed Rob when he said that his hostility towards Hermione and Krum was about: *”Fraternizing with the enemy.”* I didn’t realize it was romantic rivalry.

3) I thought that when Umbridge was using hand motions to communicate with Hagrid during his inspection, she was mocking him for, as she put it: *”Resorting to crude sign language”* when he mimed the thestrals having wings. I didn’t realize that this, along with the slow, loud voice she used, was about treating Hagrid like an idiot.

4) I always read Umbridge’s silly interrupting cough as her literally saying the words: *”Hem hem.”*

5) When Umbridge and her gang snuck up on Hagrid at midnight, I didn’t realize they were trying to actually attack him with force. I thought they were just sneaking up on him to fire him in private, in the middle of the night. The reason I thought this is that Ernie Macmillan speculated that Umbridge clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawny’s. She didn’t *attack* Trelawny, she just fired her in a way that caught a lot of attention, so from Ernie’s words I concluded that she was just doing the same thing to Hagrid in private. This was something that confused me. I didn’t really get how a sacking suddenly escalated into a full-blown fight, or why this was a horrible enough method of sacking to infuriate Hermione so much.

6) I didn’t realize that “Won-Won” was Lavender’s mushy way of saying the name “Ron.” It sounded so much like “Wonton” that I honestly thought it was something Asian. Needless to say, I was very confused by that part.

Then coming to his fifth year, yes Albus made a big mistake ignoring Harry and forcing him to take lessons with Severus, but he himself admit it, and making mistakes is natural, although it did cost Harry too much, you can not ignore that Albus still had Harry's best interest at heart and he tried to make the correct decision, in which he obviously failed, he was not intentionally making Harry suffer throughout the School year. Last coming to him raising Harry as a Pig for slaughter, I honestly believe that Albus did forsee that Harry can make it through when the Horocrux inside him was destroyed, after all, he did have a fantastic larger plan. And he really loved Harry and his family, remember when he was saying ""do not kill them, kill me"" in the Half Blood Prince? Harry himself acknowledges that. And Albus' portrait was in tears when Harry met him after the battle of Hogwarts. And during the Half Blood Prince, Albus was determined to find out as much as he could about the Horocruxes until his last breath to repay Harry for the previous year's mistakes. All in all, Albus did make some mistakes, but he had Harry's and the magical world's best interests at heart and he tried as much as he could to keep them all safe after he was gone.

,harrypotter,"(Obligatory I'm on mobile, sorry for errors)

First off, starting with the prophecy it says ""neither can live while the other survives"" meaning between the two people one of them will die and one of them will live, obviously. Dumbledore says clearly to Harry he's doing everything he can to make sure Harry is the one who survives. 

The next part of the prophecy is that Harry will have a power of the dark Lord knows not. Dumbledore instantly recognizes this as the power of love. Even when Voldemort was a kid Dumbledore recognized that Voldemort didn't know what it meant to be a friend and he didn't know what it meant to care about others and therefore he didn't understand or value love. So after Harry survived when he was a baby, what does Dumbledore do? He sends Harry to his family. At this point I don't think he knew they would abuse Harry (cause let's be fair, all Dumbldore knew about Petunia was that she's muggle who envied her magical sister, wanting so badly to be a witch herself, perhaps she would then respect or value the magical world? Turns out she didn't, but to be fair again, all Dumbledore had to go on we're letters written 10+ years ago and he *did* plead to her to treat Harry as her own son). Dumbledore only really knew that the blood connecting Harry to his mother and to his aunt would act as protection because that blood represented the sacrifice that Lily made to keep Harry alive, and therefore the blood sacrifice that would protect Harry from Voldemort, again because Voldemort doesn't understand the concept of sacrificing yourself solely because you love someone. Turns out the Dursleys did abuse Harry, but despite this he gained a deep appreciation for family and frieds because he didn't have either as a child.

Because Harry understood the importance of having a family, I think it drew him closer to Ron and Hermione and then later to Sirius- which is important. Even after Sirius's death when Harry's throwing things around Dumbledore's office screaming about how much it hurts Dumbledore points out to him that this pain he's feeling is his greatest strength. Why? Because Harry wanted to die rather than allow Sirius to die, which means he understood the importance of self-sacrifice in the effort to save the ones you love, a feeling that Voldemort would never and could never understand because all Voldemort cared about was power and self-preservation. 

Later when Harry understands the fullness of the prophecy and he feels the immense burden and responsibility to go and find Voldemort to kill him, Dumbledore instantly tells him he needs to go tell Ron and Hermione, they need to be with him and that even though this is very important information that needs to remain secret, Dumbldore recognized that Harry needed support from those he loves because needed companions, something that Voldemort never had (again, going back to loving others). 

But then Dumbledore also tells Harry out right, he can walk away from this, he doesn't have to have the prophecy apply to him because at the end of the day they're just words. The only reason the prophecy is affecting people is because they're acting like it's fact. But when Dumbldore asks Harry to imagine his life if he went forward without knowing about the prophecy, what would Harry naturally want to do? Harry says outright, he'd want to kill Voldemort to prevent more people from dying because Voldemort took away those he loved. That stopping Voldemort is a cause worth dying for.  Harry recognizes right then and there that it's not like he's being forced to face Voldemort but he's *choosing* to face him. All the work that Dumbledore's doing is to best ensure that Harry survives by telling Harry about the horcruxes and telling Harry how to destroy the horcruxes so that when Harry faces Voldemort, Voldemort would be just a normal mortal man though still a powerful wizard. 

I also think Dumbledore recognized the connection Harry and Voldemort shared, that Harry had accidentally become a horcrux when he was a baby and survived the curse because Voldemort's sole was so severely shattered at the point. This told Dumbledore that Harry would have to die, however when he died it would be Voldemort's soul being killed not Harry's, because again Harry's was protected by the power of love, both the love that his family had for him and also the love that he has for those around him, whereas Voldemort's soul had no protection. (And if you want to argue that there's no way Dumbledore could know this, we need to remember that about 80% of the plan to kill Voldemort was speculation. Dumbledore says himself that he's mostly guessing but typically his guesses are correct).

So at the end of all, I don't think Dumbledore was preparing Harry for death, I think he knew it would be an incredibly difficult journey, but because of his theories about the power of love and about Harry being a horcrux I think  Dumbledore had a pretty good certainty that Harry would be able to survive it all because, again, he was able to feel that self sacrificial love for those around him, and be was protected by the same love from others (like, come on, at the battle of Hogwarts everyone was basically ""it's ok if I die Harry, just try to stop Voldemort""). 


TL:DR If you think Dumbldore raised Harry like a pig for slaughter, you should reread book 6",t2_8x3xhg2z,False,,0,False,Unpopular Opinion: Dumbledore did not raise Harry like a pig for slaughter.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_m55hem,False,dark,0.76,,public,22,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,22,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615788212.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Obligatory I&amp;#39;m on mobile, sorry for errors)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, starting with the prophecy it says &amp;quot;neither can live while the other survives&amp;quot; meaning between the two people one of them will die and one of them will live, obviously. Dumbledore says clearly to Harry he&amp;#39;s doing everything he can to make sure Harry is the one who survives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the prophecy is that Harry will have a power of the dark Lord knows not. Dumbledore instantly recognizes this as the power of love. Even when Voldemort was a kid Dumbledore recognized that Voldemort didn&amp;#39;t know what it meant to be a friend and he didn&amp;#39;t know what it meant to care about others and therefore he didn&amp;#39;t understand or value love. So after Harry survived when he was a baby, what does Dumbledore do? He sends Harry to his family. At this point I don&amp;#39;t think he knew they would abuse Harry (cause let&amp;#39;s be fair, all Dumbldore knew about Petunia was that she&amp;#39;s muggle who envied her magical sister, wanting so badly to be a witch herself, perhaps she would then respect or value the magical world? Turns out she didn&amp;#39;t, but to be fair again, all Dumbledore had to go on we&amp;#39;re letters written 10+ years ago and he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; plead to her to treat Harry as her own son). Dumbledore only really knew that the blood connecting Harry to his mother and to his aunt would act as protection because that blood represented the sacrifice that Lily made to keep Harry alive, and therefore the blood sacrifice that would protect Harry from Voldemort, again because Voldemort doesn&amp;#39;t understand the concept of sacrificing yourself solely because you love someone. Turns out the Dursleys did abuse Harry, but despite this he gained a deep appreciation for family and frieds because he didn&amp;#39;t have either as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Harry understood the importance of having a family, I think it drew him closer to Ron and Hermione and then later to Sirius- which is important. Even after Sirius&amp;#39;s death when Harry&amp;#39;s throwing things around Dumbledore&amp;#39;s office screaming about how much it hurts Dumbledore points out to him that this pain he&amp;#39;s feeling is his greatest strength. Why? Because Harry wanted to die rather than allow Sirius to die, which means he understood the importance of self-sacrifice in the effort to save the ones you love, a feeling that Voldemort would never and could never understand because all Voldemort cared about was power and self-preservation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later when Harry understands the fullness of the prophecy and he feels the immense burden and responsibility to go and find Voldemort to kill him, Dumbledore instantly tells him he needs to go tell Ron and Hermione, they need to be with him and that even though this is very important information that needs to remain secret, Dumbldore recognized that Harry needed support from those he loves because needed companions, something that Voldemort never had (again, going back to loving others). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then Dumbledore also tells Harry out right, he can walk away from this, he doesn&amp;#39;t have to have the prophecy apply to him because at the end of the day they&amp;#39;re just words. The only reason the prophecy is affecting people is because they&amp;#39;re acting like it&amp;#39;s fact. But when Dumbldore asks Harry to imagine his life if he went forward without knowing about the prophecy, what would Harry naturally want to do? Harry says outright, he&amp;#39;d want to kill Voldemort to prevent more people from dying because Voldemort took away those he loved. That stopping Voldemort is a cause worth dying for.  Harry recognizes right then and there that it&amp;#39;s not like he&amp;#39;s being forced to face Voldemort but he&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to face him. All the work that Dumbledore&amp;#39;s doing is to best ensure that Harry survives by telling Harry about the horcruxes and telling Harry how to destroy the horcruxes so that when Harry faces Voldemort, Voldemort would be just a normal mortal man though still a powerful wizard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think Dumbledore recognized the connection Harry and Voldemort shared, that Harry had accidentally become a horcrux when he was a baby and survived the curse because Voldemort&amp;#39;s sole was so severely shattered at the point. This told Dumbledore that Harry would have to die, however when he died it would be Voldemort&amp;#39;s soul being killed not Harry&amp;#39;s, because again Harry&amp;#39;s was protected by the power of love, both the love that his family had for him and also the love that he has for those around him, whereas Voldemort&amp;#39;s soul had no protection. (And if you want to argue that there&amp;#39;s no way Dumbledore could know this, we need to remember that about 80% of the plan to kill Voldemort was speculation. Dumbledore says himself that he&amp;#39;s mostly guessing but typically his guesses are correct).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the end of all, I don&amp;#39;t think Dumbledore was preparing Harry for death, I think he knew it would be an incredibly difficult journey, but because of his theories about the power of love and about Harry being a horcrux I think  Dumbledore had a pretty good certainty that Harry would be able to survive it all because, again, he was able to feel that self sacrificial love for those around him, and be was protected by the same love from others (like, come on, at the battle of Hogwarts everyone was basically &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s ok if I die Harry, just try to stop Voldemort&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR If you think Dumbldore raised Harry like a pig for slaughter, you should reread book 6&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"(Yes, of course the REAL Mad-Eye was never actually a teacher, but my point stands regardless. Also, disclaimer: I'm a girl)

During the Yule Ball, ""Moody"" compliments Harry on his socks, which he'd received from Dobby. But Moody couldn't see those socks through conventional methods; he saw them using his magical false eye. Immediately after this, Parvati said she thought Moody and his eye were ""so creepy,"" which Harry pretty much dismissed because he liked Moody. When I first read this as a teenager, I didn't think much of it.

But now? Of COURSE any teenage girl would be weirded out by Moody's magical eye! It can clearly see through clothing, so girls like Parvati would know that Moody was completely capable of seeing their underwear...or perhaps underneath. We're never truly certain how Moody's eye works - does he have to put forth effort to see certain things (like socks under robes), or does he just see these things automatically? Regardless, this would be seriously creepy.

If he were my teacher, I would be wondering if he was keeping his eye to himself, so to speak. So many older men creep on teenage girls - almost every girl I know has dealt with a male teacher or coach that gave them the creeps (myself included). I would lump Moody into the same category. His actual intent would be irrelevant in my eyes; the mere fact that he was capable of essentially undressing me with his eye would be enough to make me very uncomfortable in his presence. I would think ""he looked at Harry's socks under his robes and then *commented on them* to Harry; what is he looking at on me?!""

Now, do I think that the *real* Alastor Moody would do anything sexually inappropriate? No, I do not.

I’m currently reading the series with boys I’ve nannied for (6.5 and 8.5) and we’re having the best time.

We’re currently wrapping up Prisoner of Azkaban, and we’ve spent a decent amount of time lately discussing character development and analysis. 

They think Harry is brave and kind, and clearly see him as the hero. Hermione always makes them giggle with her adoration for homework and rules but we’ve also been discussing that she often acts as a moral compass for her friends, and leads people towards empathy. They think Ron is silly and we’ve discussed the importance of comic relief during tense moments. They’ve also pointed out that Harry is the bravest out of the three, although they all ended up in Gryffindor. We talk about all of the characters at length, but those three obviously take center stage.

,harrypotter,"This past week I finished up reading Half Blood Prince, and I literally just got done with the movie and hopped on here to make this post. I've been doing that for the past couple months, reading the book then watching the movie before moving onto the next.

I always knew that there was more info in the books because, well, its a book, but once I watched Goblet of Fire I started noticing just HOW MUCH they have to cut out or just rush through in the later movies.

the lyrics just work perfect for the dementors. i just thought i'd share this because it works so well.




lyrics:

The air begins to feel a little thin

As I start the car, and then I begin

To add the miles piled up behind me

I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south

I want to crack the door so I can just fall out

But then I remember when you packed my car

You reached in the back and buckled up your heart

For me to drive away with

I began to understand why God died

The demons sat there waiting on her porch

It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch

And when my car was far out of sight

He crept in her room and stayed there for the 
night

And then I felt chills in my bones

The breath I saw was not my own

I knew my skin that wrapped my frame

Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand

He laid it out, what he had planned

And then I said I'll take the grave

Please just send them all my way

And then I felt chills in my bones

The breath I saw was not my own

I knew my skin that wrapped my frame

Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand

He laid it out, what he had planned

And then I said I'll take the grave

Please just send them all my way

I began to understand why God died

The air begins to feel a little thin

As we're waiting for the morning to begin

But for now you told me to hold this jar

Guys, the story isn't complex in the movies or the books. Yes, the movies cut out detail. What movie doesn't? And I've been hard pressed to find a movie I actually enjoyed more than reading the book. But the book snobs on this sub are ridiculous. 

The movies are absolutely beloved. Harry Potter movie marathons are played all the time. The movies were record setting. And think of all the book-to-movies that were not good at all! While I found the movies to be lackluster I still find myself catching one of those movie marathons. I still find myself owning the DVDs (I bet you do too). 

And as technology grows and grows and more time spaces out; you know we are going to get a remake of the movies at some point. Perhaps mini-series; or a streaming special. 

I absolutely loved growing up with the Harry Potter books and movies. I reread all the books last summer and still found that same enjoyment. I caught myself finding things I missed the first time around. I caught myself wishing things in the movies were different. But you know what?

,harrypotter,"I see a lot of fics and some posts about what if Neville was the boy who lived,most of these have Neville follow the same events that Harry and the trio did just with Ginny and Luna. I also see what if Harry had died in GOF. In half of these,it’s just Neville taking over doing all the things that Harry and the trio did,just Ginny and Luna are the trio. However imo this wouldn’t be accurate.

If Voldemort had gone after Neville, there are certain factors we would have to think about: Was it his mum or dad who would protect him, would he still live with his grandma? Would he grow up away from all the fame like Harry?

If it was his dad who did it, he most likely would grow up with his grandma,which I think would leave with worse with his fears cause of the pressure. He would grow up hearing how he was the boy who lived, he would defeat Voldemort. Maybe even have dumbledore visit him. 

His friends wouldn’t be Ginny and Luna , he only met them through the DA , which isn’t until 5th year. I don’t think hermione would ever become his close friend,as she just wouldn’t have the patience in her first year(not hermione/Neville  bashing) I’m not saying Neville is an idiot ,hermione just wouldnt have time for his insecurities,something that she got a lot better at overtime, I still think Ron would become friends with Harry, they just have so chemistry, I also think hermione would be the same if they manage to become friends,which the hard part. Anyway, how does Neville do all these things on his own? Easy answer: he can’t AT THIS STAGE.

The thing that set Harry apart is that after all those years he still had the courage, he had the courage to go battle a troll, to go get the stone (I also think he would of been much much much more insecure and wouldn’t done have the things he did with out Ron and hermione but anyway) Neville needed support and that’s totally okay, he wouldn’t have been ready like many 11 year olds. Neville could have done all this maybe in this 3rd year? I don’t really know? The DA really helped him cause he was getting positive  support from harry.

Harry would have grown up loved,with the mum and dad and Sirius and Remus,I think he still would of gone to gryfinndor to please his parents more than avoiding slytherin, he would be more confident and know he has a family, he wouldn’t be as close to the Weasleys, however I see Ron becoming close the potters, to not feel insecure at his home cause he wasn’t special enough. Hermione would form a bond with lily since there both muggleborn, are smart etc

I don’t think lily and snape would of reconciled they were just to far gone and Harry would of taken the brunt of it but never told his mum in fear of there being a fight.

,harrypotter,"So, we always see critiques of the films about some book moments that aren't included, or the infamous ""Dumbledore said, **calmly**"", but I don't really see a lot of appreciation, so thought I'd just go through why all the films are just awesome, and why I can't pick a worst or best.

Philosophers Stone - introduction to the series, so much warmth, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and the Great Hall, and it is just such a heart warming film to watch and was done so well.

Chamber of Secrets - once again, just so warm and it was great to see the Burrow, the scene with the Cornish pixies was amazing, as was the acromantula scene and polyjuice potion scene, and the basilisk scene was so entertaining to watch, and Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Lockhart was just awesome.

Prisoner of Azkaban - cinematography = AMAZING, I loved all those exterior shots, and I loved seeing the Hogwarts students in normal muggle clothes, and the whole shrieking shack scene has had me glued to the screen every time I watch the movie.

Goblet of Fire - really cool to see all the teenager stuff Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through like dating, and the scene with Voldemort returning and Cedric's death was done SO well, I could feel Harry's shock and fear just radiating through the screen.

Order of the Phoenix - I've seen a lot of people say this is the worst movie, but I can't see why. Imelda Staunton played Umbridge brilliantly, and the scene with Fred and George and the fireworks was so fun to watch. Daniel portrays Harry's difficulty over dealing with what happened last year really well, and Harry's anger is of course understandable, the poor guy has really had a traumatic life, and of course, we know he's only going to go through more trauma. The battle at the Ministry was just... I have no words. It was amazing, and of course Sirius's death was heartbreaking, and the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was just... WOAH.

Half-Blood Prince - once again, really entertaining to see the average teenager sides of the Golden Trio, and the scene with the fire at the Burrow was so entertaining, and Dumbledore's death scene was so dramatic and dark and just done so well (I am aware that I am repeating ""so well"" a lot, it has become clear to me through writing this post that my vocabulary is a lot more limited than I thought), and Tom Felton portrayed Draco's fear really well as well, and Bellatrix in the Great Hall was done amazingly.

Deathly Hallows Part 1 - the 7 Harry's scene was so entertaining to watch, the wedding was fun, then seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione trying to hunt down the Horcruxes and facing obstacles was really entertaining, and with the whole fight scene between Ron and Harry, Emma, Dan, and Rupert all did that really well. Just want to say, about the dance between Harry and Hermione after Ron left, I know some people see that as Harry and Hermione being romantic, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Harry sees his friend is upset and awkwardly tries to make her feel better. There is no romantic tension, just two friends dancing around, trying to distract themselves from what is going on in the world around them. Finally, the Malfoy Manor scene was done really well, and Hermione's torture was heartbreaking, Emma did a really good job.

Deathly Hallows Part 2 - what can I say? The end of the series, I loved the dragon scene, and I just need to express the cinematography of the battle of hogwarts. I mean, it was absolutely beautifully done, the shield around Hogwarts, the death eaters breaking it, the battle as a whole, AHH, just loved it. And the music was also beautiful, and added so much to the movie. Harry meeting Voldemort in the forbidden forest, Harry fighting and killing Voldemort, the movie as a whole. I honestly have no words, it was just an amazing climax to the series.

,harrypotter,"There's always been something that bothers me about Hermione's portrayal in the movies that I haven't been able to articulate until recently.

In the books, Hermione can be really *mean.* But that aspect of her personality is only shown, at best, in parts of the first film, before stripping away not just her mean streak, but most of her self-confidence.

In PoA, there are a *lot* of harsh and tactless comments that Hermione makes towards Ron that the film cut out.

In GoF, Hermione doesn't really care about Ron's jealousy during the Yule Ball and she has a great time. The movie added that bit where she breaks down in tears on the steps.

Perhaps the most succinct example of this is this one line in Order of the Phoenix, present in both the book and the film:

&gt;“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.

You read that? *""Nastily,""* that's the word used. In the movie, however, Emma Watson says the line so meekly that you can barely hear her, it's like Hermione is afraid to say it.

It's really no wonder that so many people who watched the movies first hated the Ron/Hermione romance. The movies changed it from two stubborn equals sparring with each other to an idiot asshole bullying a girl with self-confidence issues for seven years. Even some people who read the books first have turned against it, and I think that's larely because the movies have replaced the books in the popular consciousness in a lot of ways, since people tend to rewatch movies a lot more than they reread books, and visual images get more stuck in your brain than just your imagination from text.

There's this narrative in the fandom that Emma Watson was absolutely perfect for Hermione and no one else could have played her, but the performance just doesn't reflect that.",t2_8vyrt0y7,False,,0,False,Hermione in the movies is way too.....NICE.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_m466rs,False,dark,0.89,,public,158,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,158,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615670534.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s always been something that bothers me about Hermione&amp;#39;s portrayal in the movies that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to articulate until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the books, Hermione can be really &lt;em&gt;mean.&lt;/em&gt; But that aspect of her personality is only shown, at best, in parts of the first film, before stripping away not just her mean streak, but most of her self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In PoA, there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of harsh and tactless comments that Hermione makes towards Ron that the film cut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GoF, Hermione doesn&amp;#39;t really care about Ron&amp;#39;s jealousy during the Yule Ball and she has a great time. The movie added that bit where she breaks down in tears on the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most succinct example of this is this one line in Order of the Phoenix, present in both the book and the film:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You read that? &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Nastily,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; that&amp;#39;s the word used. In the movie, however, Emma Watson says the line so meekly that you can barely hear her, it&amp;#39;s like Hermione is afraid to say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really no wonder that so many people who watched the movies first hated the Ron/Hermione romance. The movies changed it from two stubborn equals sparring with each other to an idiot asshole bullying a girl with self-confidence issues for seven years. Even some people who read the books first have turned against it, and I think that&amp;#39;s larely because the movies have replaced the books in the popular consciousness in a lot of ways, since people tend to rewatch movies a lot more than they reread books, and visual images get more stuck in your brain than just your imagination from text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s this narrative in the fandom that Emma Watson was absolutely perfect for Hermione and no one else could have played her, but the performance just doesn&amp;#39;t reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"Basically every year has 5 girls and 5 boys per house. It's never mentioned, but it's assumed as you would figure that it would be commented on if the Gryffindors were an anomaly. The five boys in Harry's year are clear, but, famously, there are two mystery Gryffindor girls in his year (speculation on names and identities is widespread, so not for this post). Instead, we see here a problem of scale. The UK wizarding community has one major school. At that school, we see a school with about 70 students graduating each year. A tiny school, really. 

1) Why do they need a whole castle? Even if you consider the living spaces, this is a tiny school population. Even if you consider people taught at home, it's tiny. 

2) A ministry of magic with a widescale operation? For a population only large enough to have 70 graduates at their only real school? Towns with high schools with 70 students graduating have a mayor who probably owns a store in town. Maybe a three-person city council. Maybe. But a whole ministry? You'd need every single graduate to live for a hundred years or more and then to also work in the ministry to justify the scale we see in the books. And even then, it's not at all enough.

3) Everyone knows Stan Shunpike, a guy who works on a bus. Stan at the Leaky Cauldron. The one wand salesman. This indicates that the world is pretty darn small. There's one bank, one bookstore, one robe shop, etc. We get no hint that, outside of maybe Hogsmead, there's a larger world. I briefly lived in a town of 4000 that had five banks and no hospitals. The wizarding world is half that size and has one bank and a full-scale hospital. It doesn't add up. 

It's why the first three books and the last three books seem to be in two different universes. The student body needs to be drastically larger, but, even as small as it is, we still have two mystery girls in Harry's own house.

Instead, we see here a problem of scale. The UK wizarding community has one major school. At that school, we see a school with about 70 students graduating each year. A tiny school, really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Why do they need a whole castle? Even if you consider the living spaces, this is a tiny school population. Even if you consider people taught at home, it&amp;#39;s tiny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) A ministry of magic with a widescale operation? For a population only large enough to have 70 graduates at their only real school? Towns with high schools with 70 students graduating have a mayor who probably owns a store in town. Maybe a three-person city council. Maybe. But a whole ministry? You&amp;#39;d need every single graduate to live for a hundred years or more and then to also work in the ministry to justify the scale we see in the books. And even then, it&amp;#39;s not at all enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Everyone knows Stan Shunpike, a guy who works on a bus. Stan at the Leaky Cauldron. The one wand salesman. This indicates that the world is pretty darn small. There&amp;#39;s one bank, one bookstore, one robe shop, etc. We get no hint that, outside of maybe Hogsmead, there&amp;#39;s a larger world. I briefly lived in a town of 4000 that had five banks and no hospitals. The wizarding world is half that size and has one bank and a full-scale hospital. It doesn&amp;#39;t add up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why the first three books and the last three books seem to be in two different universes. The student body needs to be drastically larger, but, even as small as it is, we still have two mystery girls in Harry&amp;#39;s own house. The quaintness of the school and the sprawling world outside can&amp;#39;t both exist.&lt;/p&gt;

I was much more of a reader than any of the rest of the family, especially one of my brothers.

I've never in my life read through an entire series of this length in binge fashion before so that was interesting.

I'm not sure whether I think it deserves to be in the genre canon of LotR, SW, etc, but it was definitely an enjoyable read and I'm glad I finally got over myself to do this.

My Goodreads Ratings
Sorcerer's Stone: ***
Chamber of Secrets: ****
Prisoner of Azkaban: ****
Goblet of Fire: *****
Order of the Phoenix: ***
Half-Blood Prince: *****
Deathly Hallows: ****

The highlights of the series for me were Goblet of Fire and Half-Blood Prince. Both were solid stories that had good through line driving the main story from beginning to end. Azkaban would come next. My biggest issue with it is that I think entirely too much of the story hinges on exposition given in the Shrieking Shack. If that had been spread out a bit more or more clues dropped along the way it would be up there with 4 and 6. Chamber of Secrets was the book I knew the most about going into it from having seen at least of the movie in snippets over the years, but that didn't dampen my enjoyment of it. I've been surprised that it seems many think it is the weakest of the series because I enjoy it a lot more than Sorcerer's Stone.

Order of the Phoenix was a pretty big disappointment because it's sitting between two much better books and all of the characters just seem to act dumb all the way through. There's not enough of a consistent through line compared to the better books. I think she really started pulling her punches here. It was somewhat unbelievable that so many wizards could be trying to kill each other and only one ends up dying. It's entirely possible that my enjoyment was somewhat less because it seemed very topical at the time I was reading it. The Ministry denying the return of Voldemort felt extremely similar to me to a certain president thinking they had won an election in terms of how both were so far divorced from reality. This is the chapter in which I think the movie improves on many aspects. The Ministry of Magic and the battle at the end of the story was much more impressive to me on film than it was on the page. I've not yet watched the last 3 movies.

Deathly Hallows was a mixed bag and the book I'm still trying to make up my mind about. It doesn't feel to me like she had the actual mechanics of the endgame mapped out well enough. I think if she had then some of Dumbledore's history would have fit better in book 6 alongside the histories of Voldemort and Snape. The search for the horcruxes is a nice extension from book 6, but the Hallows seem to come out of nowhere. The Battle of Hogwarts is ultimately fairly satisfying but again she pulls her punches with there being only 3 named characters amongst the rows and rows of dead in the Great Hall. The logic behind the ownership of the Elder Wand also leaves something to be desired. I think I have finally gotten my head wrapped around it but it took a lot of thought and conversation with multiple other people to really figure it out. And finally it was probably too much to expect, but I think it would have been a much stronger ending if she had allowed Harry to stay dead. The logic of the prophecy and how he is able to come back from the dead again is another one that strains the mind. It could have been worked around by allowing Neville to ultimately vanquish Voldemort following Harry's final sacrifice.

I'm still trying to decide whether I think JKR was any good at planning ahead or just really good at taking old stuff and making it fit what she needed (diary later becomes Horcrux, Dumbledore tells Harry Voldemort cannot die, mention of Grindelwald in book 1). I've been listening to the Binge Mode HP podcasts since finishing the series (currently on book 3) and they seem to think it was good planning. I think the biggest argument against JKR being good at planning is that the Deathly Hallows is not mentioned at all until book 7.

,harrypotter,"Rereading the books for the first time in a long while, and just finished the first one. Spoilers ahead.

The final chapter of the book is titled ""The Man With Two Faces"". Obviously this is referring to Quirrel who turns out is not who he seems to be, and also literally has a second face on the back of his head.

But this time around it struck me that is not the only man with two faces in this chapter. After his confrontation with Quirrel, Harry wakes up in the hospital and has a lengthy conversation with Dumbledore. Dumbledore at first seems like a kind, wise old man who always has everyone's best interest in mind, though later on in the series we come to realize this isn't necessarily the case. He has a habit of concealing the truth from people and sort of uses them to achieve greater ends.

Hermione even mentions in this chapter that Dumbledore may not be so noble as he seems at first. Harry says something like ""I think Dumbledore intended for me to go after the stone."" To which Hermione replies ""That's really terrible! You could have died!"" And she's right. Dumbledore had no way of knowing that the trio would make it through the ordeal ok, and should never have left the school if he thought they were going after the stone. Especially if Dumbledore suspected Voldemort was involved.

But even further than that Snape is revealed in this chapter to also be two-faced!  Throughout the book he's a bitter mean-spirited bully, but in this chapter Dumbledore reveals that Snape is in fact a decent person at heart.

,harrypotter,"To me half blood prince book is a masterpiece. Its my second favourite book in the series and closely second. This a alot of hp fans least favourite movie and I can understand but the criticisms feel oddly similar when someone reviews this movie. Doesn't mean that the review is bad it just feels like deja vu sometimes, but me I wanna focus on the stuff that I just despised in this movie and without further ado let us begin.

**1. DRACO MALFOY**

For real Half of this movie is basically just sad Draco scenes and I hate it. For context Draco is one of my least favourite characters, I really hate him so much. But in this book, he's the most interesting I love his plan in this book and harry's obsession with Draco, its so fun to read. His full entire plan is not even shown in the movie, we don't see him using crabbe and Goyle at all or him putting the imperious curse on rosmerta, and that annoys me to death. Its so much fun seeing all of this stuff just unravel in the end, its like such a amazing moment seeing his full plan come together seeing him explain it to Dumbledore and  without it, it just kinda makes Dumbledore's death scene kinda pointless. In the books the chapter is not just Dumbledore dying, Its Draco's plan that gets told and everything all the little clues in the books, start to make sense. All the books have this its used best in POA and GOF, but idk man something about it being here is amazing. Draco In the other movies didn't really feel like a threat at all, I mean even in this one he just seems sad and mopey and he's ''misunderstood'' like wtf. Draco used the unforgivable curse on an innocent lady, almost used crucio on harry, let death eaters into the castle, scarred bills face, tried to poison Dumbledore but poisoned Ron instead and gave Katie bell a cursed necklace. But he's still the '''misunderstood''' wtf, And yes I am blaming the movie for this bcz they don't show him as evil as he was in the books.

**2. HARRY AND DUMBLEDORE**

This book had a job to make harry and Dumbledore's relationship feel genuine so harry can feel betrayed by him in the next book. But in this movie harry and Dumbledore just seem like how they were in like book 1. In this book harry becomes Dumbledore's man through and through ( a line they left out of the movie wtf) Dumbledore and harry becomes more than just a student and headmaster relationship, no line exemplifies this better than this line:

*“I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.”*

This is right after what happened in the cave for context, Dumbledore just relived his worst memory ever, fought off inferi, is weak as Frick and he still puts his trust In harry. What a legend, The movie however is not interested in any of this stuff and throws it out the window. ( same thing they did in DH) Its like do the filmmakers even care about Dumbledore and harry? I don't think so and that is unacceptable. Harry and Dumbledore's relationship is what defines book 6 for me, after not talking to harry for almost year, Dumbledore need to reconnect with harry and reconnect he does. Cutting this out is way too stupid and I will never understand why they did it or why nobody even cares.

**3. SEVERUS SNAPE**

I don't want to a Snape debate so lets just forget about that. This book is truly when harry hates Snape. This is the books when he hear about the fact that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy, and is furious and to top it all of he kills Dumbledore. Might I add what an amazing scene Imma talk about more but damn I love Dumbledore's death. The fact that harry saw the half blood prince book as a friend more than a guide really says something, he trusted that book to help him with his potions work, even used it to save Ron and used it to get Slughorn's memory. And when harry finds out its actually Snape who was it its an amazing reveal and I love it so much. The movie doesn't really earn that reveal, they barely mention the half blood prince and Snape isn't as mean or cruel as he is in the books. So it makes it feel like a throw away line, when its not. The book is called the half blood prince, why did anyone think it was a good idea to cut this out? its a fucking disgrace. They butchered the book. They ruined it. 

**4. HARRY'S OBSESSION**

In the entire series, This is in the only book where harry is actually right and I love that. Nobody believes him or cares enough to believe. Tonks, Mr Weasley, Lupin, Dumbledore, Mcgonnagoll, Ron, Hermione didn't believe him with his Draco death eater theory and the fact that he was right, makes the reveal much more sad and impactful, Think about it in all the other books harry was wrong.

Book 1: harry thinks Snape is stealing the stone

Book 2: harry thinks Draco is the heir of Slytherin

Book 3: harry thinks Sirius is bad

Book 4: harry thinks karkaroff put his name in the goblet

Book 5: harry thinks Voldemort is after a weapon

Book 7: harry thinks the deathly hallows symbol is an eye

But in book 6, harry was right. I don't really get that same feeling in the movie though, because they barely focus on it. Harry doesn't camp outside the room of requirement, he doesn't send Kreacher and Dobby, he doesn't watch the marauders map constantly looking for Draco, he doesn't eavesdrop on him during the apparition lessons, he doesn't send Ron and Hermione to check the castle when he leaves to go with Dumbledore, You see my point? none of this is included. That just kinda makes this movie feel like a disgrace to the book which it is. This movie is falling apart hard, like really hard.

**5. THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER**

This is one of my favourite chapters in the entire series. I Love this chapter so much its honestly beautiful, lets see how the movie holds up. Why the hell does Dumbledore apparate on the astronomy tower? out of all places that bruh. In the books harry's under the cloak and he's frozen in place so that he has to watch everything, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape. He could not move or talk, he can only watch. Dumbledore will never help harry again, he'll never explain anything to him ever again, he won't see the piercing blue eyes anymore. The movie doesn't feel like that, we don't get to see the full extent of harry and Dumbledore's relationship, they just seem like headmaster and student and not friends. After everything that happened that night, he heard Dumbledore begging for death, he heard the full extent of Draco's plan, he saw the dark mark in the sky and thought someone died, Hearing Dumbledore begging for mercy to Snape, scared harry more than anything that he ever experienced that night, that shook harry to the core, even just hearing the line ''Severus please'' brings me to tears every time. The movie doesn't really have that same feeling, it should have it but it doesn't. And even after Dumbledore died and harry saw his body the locket was open, and he found out that Dumbledore had died for nothing, they didn't get the horcrux. Now that is truly heartbreaking and for the first time in the series harry starts to cry. Its weird seeing our main character break down like this and worst of all, when Fawkes plays a lament to honour Dumbledore, even though he never hear the song, you can still feel the emotion. The movie is not like this at all it ruins everything that made this book so powerful ad heartbreaking, and I hate it for that. This line always bring me to tears when I read this book too:

*And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.*

Reading the ending of this book solidified this as my second favourite book of all time, but the movie doesn't even come close to the level of brilliance of this book. It never can and will, is the half blood prince a disgrace to the book? Yes. It deserves this rating of...

**2/10**",t2_8bf6rve2,False,,0,False,The Half Blood Prince Movie: A Disgrace To The Book,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/harrypotter,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_m4ph6t,False,dark,0.56,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,2,,False,spoiler,False,,[],{},,True,,1615730944.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.harrypotter,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me half blood prince book is a masterpiece. Its my second favourite book in the series and closely second. This a alot of hp fans least favourite movie and I can understand but the criticisms feel oddly similar when someone reviews this movie. Doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the review is bad it just feels like deja vu sometimes, but me I wanna focus on the stuff that I just despised in this movie and without further ado let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. DRACO MALFOY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For real Half of this movie is basically just sad Draco scenes and I hate it. For context Draco is one of my least favourite characters, I really hate him so much. But in this book, he&amp;#39;s the most interesting I love his plan in this book and harry&amp;#39;s obsession with Draco, its so fun to read. His full entire plan is not even shown in the movie, we don&amp;#39;t see him using crabbe and Goyle at all or him putting the imperious curse on rosmerta, and that annoys me to death. Its so much fun seeing all of this stuff just unravel in the end, its like such a amazing moment seeing his full plan come together seeing him explain it to Dumbledore and  without it, it just kinda makes Dumbledore&amp;#39;s death scene kinda pointless. In the books the chapter is not just Dumbledore dying, Its Draco&amp;#39;s plan that gets told and everything all the little clues in the books, start to make sense. All the books have this its used best in POA and GOF, but idk man something about it being here is amazing. Draco In the other movies didn&amp;#39;t really feel like a threat at all, I mean even in this one he just seems sad and mopey and he&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;&amp;#39;misunderstood&amp;#39;&amp;#39; like wtf. Draco used the unforgivable curse on an innocent lady, almost used crucio on harry, let death eaters into the castle, scarred bills face, tried to poison Dumbledore but poisoned Ron instead and gave Katie bell a cursed necklace. But he&amp;#39;s still the &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;misunderstood&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; wtf, And yes I am blaming the movie for this bcz they don&amp;#39;t show him as evil as he was in the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. HARRY AND DUMBLEDORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book had a job to make harry and Dumbledore&amp;#39;s relationship feel genuine so harry can feel betrayed by him in the next book. But in this movie harry and Dumbledore just seem like how they were in like book 1. In this book harry becomes Dumbledore&amp;#39;s man through and through ( a line they left out of the movie wtf) Dumbledore and harry becomes more than just a student and headmaster relationship, no line exemplifies this better than this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am not worried, Harry,&amp;quot; said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. &amp;quot;I am with you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is right after what happened in the cave for context, Dumbledore just relived his worst memory ever, fought off inferi, is weak as Frick and he still puts his trust In harry. What a legend, The movie however is not interested in any of this stuff and throws it out the window. ( same thing they did in DH) Its like do the filmmakers even care about Dumbledore and harry? I don&amp;#39;t think so and that is unacceptable. Harry and Dumbledore&amp;#39;s relationship is what defines book 6 for me, after not talking to harry for almost year, Dumbledore need to reconnect with harry and reconnect he does. Cutting this out is way too stupid and I will never understand why they did it or why nobody even cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. SEVERUS SNAPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to a Snape debate so lets just forget about that. This book is truly when harry hates Snape. This is the books when he hear about the fact that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy, and is furious and to top it all of he kills Dumbledore. Might I add what an amazing scene Imma talk about more but damn I love Dumbledore&amp;#39;s death. The fact that harry saw the half blood prince book as a friend more than a guide really says something, he trusted that book to help him with his potions work, even used it to save Ron and used it to get Slughorn&amp;#39;s memory. And when harry finds out its actually Snape who was it its an amazing reveal and I love it so much. The movie doesn&amp;#39;t really earn that reveal, they barely mention the half blood prince and Snape isn&amp;#39;t as mean or cruel as he is in the books. So it makes it feel like a throw away line, when its not. The book is called the half blood prince, why did anyone think it was a good idea to cut this out? its a fucking disgrace. They butchered the book. They ruined it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. HARRY&amp;#39;S OBSESSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the entire series, This is in the only book where harry is actually right and I love that. Nobody believes him or cares enough to believe. Tonks, Mr Weasley, Lupin, Dumbledore, Mcgonnagoll, Ron, Hermione didn&amp;#39;t believe him with his Draco death eater theory and the fact that he was right, makes the reveal much more sad and impactful, Think about it in all the other books harry was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 1: harry thinks Snape is stealing the stone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 2: harry thinks Draco is the heir of Slytherin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 3: harry thinks Sirius is bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 4: harry thinks karkaroff put his name in the goblet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 5: harry thinks Voldemort is after a weapon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book 7: harry thinks the deathly hallows symbol is an eye&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in book 6, harry was right. I don&amp;#39;t really get that same feeling in the movie though, because they barely focus on it. Harry doesn&amp;#39;t camp outside the room of requirement, he doesn&amp;#39;t send Kreacher and Dobby, he doesn&amp;#39;t watch the marauders map constantly looking for Draco, he doesn&amp;#39;t eavesdrop on him during the apparition lessons, he doesn&amp;#39;t send Ron and Hermione to check the castle when he leaves to go with Dumbledore, You see my point? none of this is included. That just kinda makes this movie feel like a disgrace to the book which it is. This movie is falling apart hard, like really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite chapters in the entire series. I Love this chapter so much its honestly beautiful, lets see how the movie holds up. Why the hell does Dumbledore apparate on the astronomy tower? out of all places that bruh. In the books harry&amp;#39;s under the cloak and he&amp;#39;s frozen in place so that he has to watch everything, no matter how hard he tried, he could not escape. He could not move or talk, he can only watch. Dumbledore will never help harry again, he&amp;#39;ll never explain anything to him ever again, he won&amp;#39;t see the piercing blue eyes anymore. The movie doesn&amp;#39;t feel like that, we don&amp;#39;t get to see the full extent of harry and Dumbledore&amp;#39;s relationship, they just seem like headmaster and student and not friends. After everything that happened that night, he heard Dumbledore begging for death, he heard the full extent of Draco&amp;#39;s plan, he saw the dark mark in the sky and thought someone died, Hearing Dumbledore begging for mercy to Snape, scared harry more than anything that he ever experienced that night, that shook harry to the core, even just hearing the line &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Severus please&amp;#39;&amp;#39; brings me to tears every time. The movie doesn&amp;#39;t really have that same feeling, it should have it but it doesn&amp;#39;t. And even after Dumbledore died and harry saw his body the locket was open, and he found out that Dumbledore had died for nothing, they didn&amp;#39;t get the horcrux. Now that is truly heartbreaking and for the first time in the series harry starts to cry. Its weird seeing our main character break down like this and worst of all, when Fawkes plays a lament to honour Dumbledore, even though he never hear the song, you can still feel the emotion. The movie is not like this at all it ruins everything that made this book so powerful ad heartbreaking, and I hate it for that. This line always bring me to tears when I read this book too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the ending of this book solidified this as my second favourite book of all time, but the movie doesn&amp;#39;t even come close to the level of brilliance of this book. It never can and will, is the half blood prince a disgrace to the book? Yes. It deserves this rating of...&lt;/p&gt;

,harrypotter,"So I obviously knew what Harry Potter was before this binge. I watched a few of them sporadically throughout my childhood, but never really followed the story (to be fair, I don’t think most children really did) 

Fast forward to last month, I was on holiday for school and just thought I’d binge all the movies. I’ve never read the books (have never been much of a reader, but when I have gotten the occasional book I like in English class, I get hooked) Binged all eight movies in less than a week, then binged them again right after. I was just so addicted. Although I’ve seen people say they can’t imagine following the story without reading the books, I felt so connected to the characters, even with their apparently noticeable flaws (from the books)

I had two “questions” I hope to get answered in this post. Firstly, should I get into the books? I feel like the obvious answer is yes, but did I kind of ruin it by watching the movies first? Or will I still be able to enjoy it and learn the characters again, as I’ve been told again and again that they’re all better in the books. Secondly, how do you guys cope with this not being real? I know it’s basic to say you wish a fictional story was real, etc. but seriously. I watched the “As the World Caves In” and “Sign of the Times” mixes on YouTube and cried every time.

,harrypotter,"Once upon a time a couple months ago, yours truly thought it would be cool to see how a book would read when only reading what people shout in all caps. Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

Could not find where anyone else had done so, so I went through and noted them. Hopefully you enjoy them too, because I’m already working on book seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METHOD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will happen tonight. (Trelawney)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight…the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than he ever was.

""This one seems...familiar"" the voice continued. He could feel his heart beating against the inside of his chest. This couldn't be real, he thought. ""Oh, but it *is* real!"" the voice replied, almost as though it had heard him think. This time the boy jumped from the shock. 

*'Can you hear my thoughts?'* he said aloud in his mind. ""Your thoughts, yes, but much more than that, boy"" said the voice. ""I can see you, too. Who you are, who you might be, all the potential deep within..."" The boy took a steadying breath. Then, again in his mind, he spoke. *'You can see who I am?'* His own voice sounded unsure in his head, for the boy really didn't know who he was himself when he thought about it. 

""I can."" replied the voice. It was a soft, yet confident voice with a sharpness to it that suggested wisdom and maturity. ""I see promise, oh yes, such promise. Nearly fearless too, except for that..."" The boy screwed up his face at this. *'I am NOT scared of anything!'* he thought defiantly. 

But the voice continued on, undeterred. ""You'd make a good leader, a great one even. But there's more to you isn't there? A strong desire to prove yourself, to show the world what you can be."" Now the boy just sat, quite still, listening intently. He was starting to like what he heard, and with it he relaxed a little. As he did so, he subconsciously opened more of himself up to the all-encompassing darkness surrounding him. 

""What's this?"" the voice said softly ""You don't just want to show the world... You want to bend it to your will."" The boy said nothing in his head, but allowed memories to bubble to the surface. Memories of the people who had already seen that part of him, of people who *would* see that part of him one day. 

""I haven't seen a mind like this in almost a thousand years..."" said the voice, only now it wasn't so confident. It almost seemed fearful, as if it had seen something in this small boy that ought not to have been seen. Centuries seemed to pass by in an instant, a rushing, roaring sound rose up, dreadful in the blackness and the boy felt his heart racing, but this time it was an altogether different sensation. A rush of adrenaline that made him feel giddy. The voice understood now not just who this boy was, but why he seemed so familiar too. 

""Salazar..."" it said, in a hushed, quiet tone before roaring ""SLYTHERIN!"" out loud to the great hall. 

The boy blinked in the sudden bright light, before hurrying over to the Slytherin table where the green and silver clad students erupted in cheers.

Ron makes no attempt to stop the kiss and embraces it, instead.\n* \\[[10](https://youtu.be/ucS3xMZcrHQ?t=105)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / After Hermione runs away from the shock of seeing Ron kissing another girl, Ron gleefully skips through the halls with Lavender Brown and stumbles upon a weeping Hermione. Though he sees she is distraught, Ron doesn\'t apologize or show remorse or even abandon his frivolity with Lavender. He sees that his actions have hurt Hermione and he continues to run off with Lavender.\n\nYet, despite being treated so horribly, Hermione decides *""yeah, this sounds like a perfectly stable foundation for a relationship”* and marries him. I always wondered, where did the connection between them happen?\n\nBut upon watching the films again recently, I noticed something that I hadn\'t paid much attention to before. In the Deathly Hallows part 2, Ron Weasley performs the [**Imperius** **curse**](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse) on Bogrod, the goblin teller.\n\n* \\[[11](https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / During the scene where the trio break into Gringotts, Ron Weasley effortlessly uses the Imperius Curse on Bogrod, the goblin teller, without hesitation. Bogrod remains under the effects of the Imperius curse until his own demise at the fiery breath of the security dragon.\n\nWhen cast successfully, the Imperius Curse places the victim completely under the caster’s control (unless the victim is strong enough to resist it) and it is one of three Unforgivable Curses that witches and wizards are forbidden to use.\n\nSo why does Ron Weasley know this curse?\n\nAt first, I thought he must have originally learned about it during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson about the Unforgivable Curses in the Goblet of Fire. But when I watched the scene again, I found out that **I was wrong**.\n\nRon actually already knew about the Imperius Curse prior to Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson, and he learned it from his father, Arthur Weasley.\n\n* \\[[12](https://youtu.be/wsl5fS7KGZc)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / In the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Mad-Eye Moody provides a lesson about the three Unforgivable Curses, and he calls upon Ron to volunteer the name of one of the curses. Out of all three curses, Ron provides the Imperius Curse and says that he learned it from his father, thus showing he was already familiar with the curse.\n\nWhich leads us to our next question. When did Ron practice using the spell to be good enough to charm a goblin teller?\n\nCasting a spell in the wizarding world is not as simple as waving a wand and reading the incantation. If that were true, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wouldn’t be nearly as threatening. As we’ve seen in the films, the ability to successfully perform any spell comes the same way any good skill does – through practice and proper form.\n\n* \\[[13](https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / The students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, demonstrating that casting magic is not as simple as wand-waving and word-mumbling. Without the proper technique, a spell’s effects can have alternate (disastrous) results.\n* \\[[14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Professor Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to mend Harry’s broken arm and fails (further proving that spells are not successful if they are cast by someone who has no idea what they are doing).\n* \\[[15](https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / Harry trains with Professor Lupin to learn the Patronus Charm, but Harry is not quite able to cast the spell effectively right away. Even Chosen Ones have to practice to *git guud*.\n\nYou might be thinking, *“But Harry also* [*cast the Imperius Curse*](https://youtu.be/F9KyOu_RchU?t=186) *on a goblin and I’m sure he wasn’t running around practicing it on random folks. Maybe it’s just an easier spell to cast?”*\n\nHarry has demonstrated (on multiple occasions) a talent for spell mastery due to his unique circumstances. I would argue that part of the reason Harry was able to cast the Imperius Curse so effectively in the Deathly Hallows part 2 without prior training is because he is Voldemort’s Horcrux, and thus, inherits some of the Dark Lord’s abilities (as evidenced through Harry’s ability to speak [parseltongue](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue)). Otherwise, if the curse were really so easy to cast, why wouldn’t anyone just cast it for anything?\n\nWith that understanding, we have a reasonable guess as to why Harry can cast the curse so easily, but Ron doesn’t have any ties to the Dark Lord or the ability to master spells easily. Ron has, in fact, been historically slower at learning spells.\n\nSo, when (or **on whom**) did Ron practice the curse to become so effective at it?\n\nHe practiced it on Hermione Granger, which explains why she suddenly fell in love with him. Think about it. Ron was a jerk to Hermione across multiple films and then suddenly she’s all over him, being giddy around him, staying at his house, and calling him brilliant.\n\n*“What?! No. Ron would never do that. He might have picked on Hermione but that’s not exactly evidence that he would do something so evil as to brainwash a friend.”*\n\nOh ho-ho. Strap in, because there is evidence suggesting Ron is actually a lot darker-minded than we realized. But first, let’s talk about motive. Why would Ron even want to mind-control Hermione?\n\nIt’s because he’s jealous of her affection for Harry and is tired of being in Harry’s shadow.\n\n*“Riddikulus!”*\n\nI’m not a Boggart; that won’t work on me!\n\n*“But Hermione wasn’t attracted to Harry.”*\n\nActually, there are multiple signs that Hermione might have been initially sweet on Harry.\n\n* \\[[16](https://youtu.be/b6eIgrYraEc?t=175)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / After Hermione repairs Harry’s glasses, she recognizes him, even though they had never officially met. Harry’s scar is not visible during this scene, so she would not have recognized him via his scar but of photographs of him. Simple moments of infatuation like this are often the foundation of young crushes that lead to romantic interests.\n* \\[[17](https://youtu.be/DfjM5SUkPPg)\\] **Chamber of Secrets** / Harry is reunited with Hermione in Diagon Alley while shopping for school supplies, where she ends up repairing his glasses once again and does so with a warm smile and bright eyes.

While this can be attributed to Hermione feeling bad about Harry\'s situation, the way she lingers can also be a sign that she likes him and wished him to be there with her.\n* \\[[20](https://youtu.be/R5xJbQL1eHo?t=154)\\] **Prisoner of Azkaban** / During a quidditch match, Harry is attacked by a Dementor and falls unconscious.

She locks eyes with Harry the entire time and even plays with her hair, which can be seen as a sign of infatuation.\n* \\[[21](https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=47)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / When the Quidditch World Cup game is attacked, Hermione fearfully calls out for Harry several times (while being dragged away by Ron).\n* \\[[22](https://youtu.be/JMrQ4uE4j84)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / Just before the first trial, Hermione enters the Champions\' tent and lovingly embraces Harry out of fear and worry.\n* \\[[23](https://youtu.be/K-tLdA55c3k?t=242)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / After the second trial, Hermione rushes to check on Harry and even gives him a kiss on the head.

When Ron dismisses her offer with a snide remark (such husband material), she turns hopefully to Harry and is elated when he says that he will.\n\nThis isn’t just a series of isolated incidents being misinterpreted, either. Even Albus Dumbledore, a powerful wizard with keen intuition and sharp intellect, thought Harry and Hermione might have been together. And even **he** was surprised to hear that Harry and Hermione were not together.\n\n* \\[25\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / When Albus summons Harry to his office the first time in order to ask Harry to gain Professor Slughorn’s trust, he asks if Harry is seeing Hermione romantically.\n\nNow, imagine you’re Ron: You’re the youngest of 5 older brothers who is always in trouble (and being howled at), constantly being teased by your older siblings, and you’re given embarrassing hand-me-down items over the years. To top it all off, you’re a Weasley (a *Weasley*!), [who are looked down](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasley_family) on by other wizard families.

When Ron pushes the issue, they raise the price to ten galleons. Immediately afterward, Ron turns away defeated and says to his friends “Come on, let’s go” in a tone that sounds as if he’s dealt with this type of thing for far too long.\n\nKnow what would make it all worse? If one day, you met a boy who was stupidly famous, obscenely rich, ludicrously successful no matter what he did, and was always the center of everyone’s attention. Then that boy becomes your “best friend”, so that any light of success you have is instantly darkened by his shadow of greatness. Imagine how frustrating that must feel after a few years.\n\n* \\[[34](https://youtu.be/12hxT4URRGU?t=121)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / When Ron first meets Harry on the Hogwarts Express, he is so poor that is he unable to purchase any sweets from the trolley. But Harry flaunts his vast wealth by purchasing the entire trolley of sweets. This would be awesome for young Ron, at first, but eventually this becomes unbearable as he grows older.\n* \\[[35](https://youtu.be/f-XC-Lz2E5w?t=22)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Harry is invited to be on the Quidditch team after barley starting the school year. Some of Ron’s older siblings had been on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and it was shown that Ron was hopeful to follow their footsteps. So it must have burned to see a kid come and take a spot on the team, thinking that it might be just because of his namesake.\n* \\[[36](https://youtu.be/gq0E5QN_mvo?t=66)\\] **Sorcerer’s Stone** / Harry is gifted the Nimbus 2000, the best flying broom in the entire school (at the time), and the gift was even from a professor. If you were in Ron’s position, you would definitely notice the blatant favoritism shown to Harry Potter.\n\nAnd when you’re always in the shadow of your friend’s glory, you start becoming resentful and jealous, which prompts you to do things that make you feel successful (and in control). On a few occasions, Ron sours on Harry for seemingly no rational reason. Other times, Ron purposefully goes out of his way to keep Hermione away from Harry.\n\n* \\[[37](https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / After it is announced Harry Potter will participate in the incredibly dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, Ron becomes upset with Harry.

Instead of stopping to be a good guy and help his best friend, Ron makes it a priority to drag Hermione away from him.\n* \\[[39](https://youtu.be/bA5cIGdt9j4?t=18)\\] **Half-Blood Prince** / On the Hogwarts Express, Hermione expresses concern about Harry while leaving the train but Ron immediately dismisses her concern while urging her to follow him off the train. Ron shows no concern for Harry and is quick to pull Hermione away the minute she asks about Harry.\n\nHarry hasn’t always been the nicest friend to Ron, either.\n\n* \\[[40](https://youtu.be/ktfsgXyRbuc?t=38)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Ron attempts to console a brooding Harry and is harshly pushed away. This occurs just moments after Ron nobly defends Harry to a group of troubled Gryffindor members. This may very well have been the moment where Ron realizes that he is worthless.\n\nBut the most damning evidence of all, the one that shows us the true thoughts that plague Ron Weasley’s mind, is in the Deathly Hallows when Slytherin’s Locket, one of Voldemort’s seven Horcruxes, reveals his darkest fears and anxieties. It reinforces all of the evidence we just reviewed – that Ron feels inferior to Harry, that he feels that his family doesn’t love him, and that he’ll never have a girl like Hermione because of Harry.\n\n* \\[[41](https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / When Harry opens Slytherin’s Locket so that Ron can destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor, the locket speaks to Ron with dark whispers from his own heart. When the locket is first opened it says, *“I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.”* Among the truths we learn about Ron through the locket are that:\n* o Ron’s mother wanted a daughter.\n* o Ron’s mother once admitted that she would have preferred Harry as a son.\n* o The locket’s shadow of Hermione also said, “Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared to the Chosen One?”\n\nKeep in mind, Slytherin’s Locket could be lying in order to cripple Ron Weasley’s spirit. But also keep this in mind… If all the locket’s words were complete lies, Ron would never have been paralyzed by them. The fact is, there was truth in the locket’s words. The locket only whispered whatever dark thoughts were already in Ron’s heart. This confirms that Ron was indeed jealous of Harry, indeed frustrated about not being able to “get the girl”, and insecure about his relationship with his family. All of this, added with the other evidence, means that it is absolutely plausible that Ron may have been driven to desperation at one point, whether he meant to or not.\n\nNow that we have a motive, let’s talk about Ron’s proclivity for dark behavior. Even if we might have a plausible motive, surely our sweet Won-Won would never even think about doing something so vile as to mind-control Hermione. Right?\n\nBut actually, he’s shown us that maybe he’s not the most noble Gryffindor.\n\n* \\[[42](https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / While eating, Nigel Wolpert delivers a parcel to Ron then awkwardly lingers until Ron dismisses him. When Hermione gives Ron a questioning look, he admits that he promised Nigel Harry’s autograph. Ron basically admitted to securing favors (such as servitude) in exchange for celebrity items, which shows a willingness to use his friendship with Harry to his personal benefit.\n* \\[[43](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner where the trio are deciding what to do with the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley is the first one to unflinchingly suggest murder showing that he clearly has a dark side. When Hermione meekly protests, Ron tries to justify his cruelty. Harry has to be the voice of reason by suggesting an alternate, less criminal solution.\n\nSo now we have a motive, evidence that Ron had knowledge of the curse to carry out the act, and we have seen evidence of Ron’s darker personality.\n\n*“But the Imperius Curse only works on weak-minded wizards. Hermione is definitely not weak. Ron wouldn’t be able to charm someone as strong-willed as her.”*\n\n[Right you are, Harry!](https://youtu.be/sf1dH0Bibyk?t=9) The films have demonstrated Hermione to be a strong wizard, amazingly smart and incredibly skilled in a variety of subjects and skillsets. Normally, I would wager that Hermione would be able to resist the Imperius Curse. Except, Hermione is not always strong willed. In fact, when it comes to her friends, we’ve seen her succumb to their requests before.\n\nIt’s entirely possible that, while Hermione would normally be able to resist an Imperius Curse from anyone else, she’s not as strong willed when it comes to her friends. [Stress can also have negative impacts on a person’s mental and emotional willpower](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/), and we’ve seen Hermione go through a lot of emotional distress with her friends throughout the films, from worrying about Harry’s safety to running off crying because of Ron’s cruel comments. The stress Hermione deals with could have also attributed to her not being able to counter the Imperius Curse.\n\nI believe Ron took advantage of that fact to **groom** Hermione and lower her defenses so that he could successfully curse her.\n\n[Grooming](http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming) is a tactic seen in abusive relationships where a person’s normal defenses (or strong wills) are overcome by slowly desensitizing them to abusive behaviors. It often works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse.\n\n* \\[[44](https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0)\\] **Goblet of Fire** / While Harry is down by the lake with Neville, Hermione approaches Harry with a message from Ron, who is seen standing just a yard behind her. It is clear that Hermione is not thrilled about being used by Ron to deliver a message to a person he is within speaking distance of, but she does so anyway. After failing the first attempt, Hermione attempts to withdraw from the commitment and urges Ron to deliver the message. Ron pushes back and forces Hermione to follow through. Ron\'s choice to force Hermione to carry out such an asinine command can be seen as an attempt by him to assert his authority and will over her. This is considered [manipulation](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html), which is another form of abuse, where the manipulator (Ron) gets the victim to do something they don’t want to do through a variety of techniques.\n* \\[[45](https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / During the scene at the diner, after Harry makes the decision to wipe the memories of the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley approaches Hermione, caresses her face, then tells her to perform the act of wiping the Death Eater\'s memory. This part of a grooming process, where the abuser (Ron) asks their victim (Hermione) to perform various acts that make them feel just as guilty as the abuser. Ron further imposes himself upon Hermione by making physical contact prior to giving a command. Note, that Ron doesn\'t ask Hermione to do it. If he truly cared about her, he would realize that wiping someone\'s memory might be a sensitive subject considering she just had to wipe her parents\' memories. Instead, Ron commands her to do it and Hermione follows through without any protest though it is visibly clear that she is completely uncomfortable with it. This is an example of grooming.\n* \\[[46](https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / While in search of a way to destroy Slytherin’s Locket, the trio take turns carrying the Horcrux. While Ron carries the locket, he starts being overwhelmed by its darkness. Just being near the locket draws out the darkest fears and anxieties of a person. In this case, it happens to be Ron’s jealousy of Hermione. Ron’s jealousy eventually becomes so unbearable that he fights with Harry and then decides to leave. But before doing so, he stops to ask Hermione if she’s staying or going. This is an example of [basic coercive](https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html) techniques often used by abusers in relationships where the abuser (Ron) tries to maintain his control by forcing the victim to choose between them or something else. It’s like horrific “all or nothing” scenario where the victim, who clearly has feelings for the abuser, is muddled by the sudden pressure to abruptly make a decision that will have major lasting impacts. Typically, the victim in this situation would surrender to the side of the abuser, because the pressure of making that kind of decision in the moment is too great, and it’s hard for anyone to just walk away. But in this case, we see Hermione actually resist. Interesting how she can do that when she’s not under a mind-controlling curse. It’s clear that Ron’s only method of maintaining relationships is through coercion, manipulation, and mind-control, at this point.\n\nRon just isn’t an insensitive brat, he’s an abusive friend and a manipulator, as well.\n\nThe fact that Hermione is a victim of abuse and a victim of the Imperius Curse becomes even more clear during the Deathly Hallows, when Ron decides to leave out of jealousy. After Ron leaves, Harry and Hermione instantly start connecting, almost as if Hermione changes without Ron’s influence.\n\n* \\[[47](https://youtu.be/GM5WI4MTXzc)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 1** / After Ron has left, some time passes, and Harry and Hermione are sitting alone together in their camping tent when they make a sudden connection. As if Hermione is starting to wake up from a nightmare.\n\nSo, now we have to determine: When did it all happen? At what point did Ron lose himself and do the unthinkable to Hermione?\n\nConsidering all the evidence, I believe, sometime during the Order of the Phoenix, Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger. This is the time we start seeing Hermione hang around Ron a little more closely but she hasn’t quite started falling over him. That happens during the events of the Half-Blood Prince where Hermione is not only sleeping over at Ron’s house a few days before the start of the school year but she’s also looking at him more and becoming incredibly upset when he runs off with other girls.\n\nMore specifically, I believe it may have first occurred during the winter break of the school year during Order of the Phoenix.\n\n* \\[[48](https://youtu.be/-mJqm_ijE6s?t=25)\\] **Order of the Phoenix** / Inside the House of Black, the Weasleys celebrate the Christmas holiday with the return of Arthur Weasley (who had been previously attacked) and exchange presents. When Ron opens his present, Hermione smiles warmly at Ron. This is odd because in the previous scene, Hermione is digging at Ron with her usual sharp wit. There is seemingly no reason for her to smile at Ron like that during something as simple as unwrapping a present unless something had happened between them. Maybe they cozied up during the winter break? Or maybe, Ron decided he’d had enough of being the sidekick of the group and used the Imperius Curse on Hermione for the first time. This scene occurs after Harry snaps at Ron, who was only trying to help \\[39\\]. Notice, too, in this scene that Hermione does not greet Harry when he arrives. She has typically given Harry big, bright welcomes in the past but here, she only gives him a frowning glance. This could suggest that Ron used the Imperius Curse to also tone-down Hermione’s enthusiasm for Harry.\n\n*“But Hermione doesn’t look like she’s under the influence of the Imperius Curse.”*\n\nThe films have been inconsistent with how the Imperius Curse is represented. For example, in the Goblet of Fire, [victims of the curse are shown to have milky eyes](https://youtu.be/FyqA7eWrFt8?t=123). But during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson on the Unforgiveable Curses \\[12\\], the Professor says that many wizards and witches claimed they only followed Lord Voldemort because they were under the influence of the Imperius Curse, and implied it was a challenge to determine which ones were lying about being cursed. This would suggest that the curse does not always manifest itself in a visible way. Additionally, in the Deathly Hallows, when Ron and Harry use the Imperius Curse on the goblins \\[11\\], the victim does not adopt any physical characteristics that would imply they are bewitched.\n\nBased on this, we can safely assume that people under the influence of the Imperius Curse are not always going to show obvious signs.\n\nBut while I believe Ron bewitched Hermione, I don’t believe Hermione was under the influence the entire time. I believe Ron used the curse a few times in short bursts. Just long enough to start grooming Hermione so that she notices him instead of Harry. I also believe that the kiss Ron and Hermione share during the Deathly Hallows part 2 is not because of the Imperius Curse, but is a direct consequence of Hermione being cursed multiple times.\n\nIf you’re still not convinced, if there’s even a shred of doubt still lingering after considering all of the evidence, then let me leave you with one last thing.\n\nAt the end of the Deathly Hallows pt. 2, when our beloved trio of friends (now adults with children of their own) watch their children ride towards Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express, look at Ron’s expression.\n\n* \\[[49](https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=117)\\] **Deathly Hallows pt. 2** / In the final scene of the entire film series, Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk their children to platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express. We learn that Ron is now a father of three adorable little Weasley-Granger children. Harry and Hermione warmly smile as they watch their children ride off toward their first Hogwarts adventures but Ron shows no emotion. In fact, he looks a little depressed.\n\nRon. Looks. **Destroyed**. Hermione is smiling. Harry is smiling. But Ron? Ron looks like he dun goofed.

He would be destroyed because even the happy moments wouldn\'t be happy they would just make him feel more guilty, so when everyone is happy at the end this just makes him even more depressed in the false life he has imprisoned himself in.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Link](https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=230)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...As soon as the train pulls away and everyone waves it immediately cuts back to them and you can see Ron look down at his child.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The way he looks down doesn\'t seem to be proud or happy it looks incredibly guilty in my opinion!!\n\nExpertly said, brother SeaWarrior.\n\nIn conclusion… [Ron is a right foul git](https://youtu.be/GCqsItHrwoo), and now **you** know it.\n\n    TLDR Version\n\n**What happened?**\n\nRon Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger to make her fall in love with him, instead of Harry Potter.\n\n**Why would you think that?**\n\nRon treats Hermione very poorly across all the films and Hermione doesn\'t take it well.

Though the films are based on the books, the films are different; changes were made to the original story. The films aren\'t continuing the story of Harry Potter, they are retelling it. Unfortunately, within the film universe\'s retelling, there is plenty of evidence there to suggest Ron used the Imperius Curse on Hermione so that she would fall for him.\n\n    Edit - Additional Evidence (Provided by YOU!)\n\n[u/JohnWickIsMyPatronus](https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnWickIsMyPatronus) writes...\n\n&gt;I happen to be watching Goblet of Fire right now, and I noticed something that also points to Ron being abusive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the ball after Harry introduces Ron to the Patels as their dates, and Mcgonagall says that Harry has to do a customary dance at the beginning of the ball, Ron and one of the Patels start off toward the hall. While walking toward the hall, Patel looks back with a bit of disappointment toward Harry and the other Patel. Ron looks along with her, clearly upset with his robes and jealous of Harry\'s robes. Right after that, he grabs Patel by the arm and forces her to walk toward the hall while muttering ""let\'s go.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It\'s the grabbing of the arm and forcing her somewhere that makes it seem like he\'s comfort doing so, and maybe has done it before. [Looking closer at it,  he clearly gives her a push toward the dance.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;t=1m55s)\n\n\\[[E1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;t=1m55s)\\] This adds supporting evidence to the idea that Ron was becoming increasingly resentful of Harry and also provides additional evidence of Ron\'s controlling (almost possessive) behavior toward women.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[u/bubblegumdog](https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegumdog) writes...\n\n&gt;I always thought the most damning evidence was the final scene in the last film (not including the epilogue) where Hermione comes up to Harry after he breaks the Elder Wand and grabs his hand and just admires him without looking away. Then Ron comes up and she takes his hand as well and then her face completely changes. Shouldn’t she have had the reaction she had with Harry with Ron instead?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One could argue she was proud of Harry at that moment for breaking the wand but it still begs the question: why does Hermione’s face fall when she grabs Ron’s hand?\n\n\\[[E2](https://youtu.be/9LcT9kisys4?t=120)\\] This adds supporting evidence that Hermione is seemingly struggling with her feelings after having been previously cursed. Look closely at Hermione\'s expression as she takes Ron\'s hand. She looks down, suddenly lost in though, then blankly looks forward. It\'s almost as if she\'s waking up and realizing that something isn\'t right. I don\'t believe she is cursed in this scene but it looks like she\'s starting to become aware that her feelings for Ron may not be natural.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'author_fullname': 't2_piswiym', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': '[Harry Potter] [Spoilers] Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger to make her fall in love with him.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/FanTheories', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'FanTheory', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_9zga7v', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.79, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 9711, 'total_awards_received': 7, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'FanTheory', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 9711, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'spoiler', 'edited': 1543007675.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 3, 'gid_2': 1, 'gid_3': 1}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1542938146.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.FanTheories', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: SPOILERS ARE ALL OVER THIS THEORY LIKE DEMENTORS ON AZKABAN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR at the bottom...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay your pitchforks, brothers; lay down your torches, sisters; hold your downvotes Reddites until you consider the following: Ron Weasley isn&amp;#39;t the cute, innocent boy he seems.

I always wondered, where did the connection between them happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But upon watching the films again recently, I noticed something that I hadn&amp;#39;t paid much attention to before. In the Deathly Hallows part 2, Ron Weasley performs the &lt;a href=""http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Imperius_Curse""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperius&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;curse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Bogrod, the goblin teller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/NSbQZlqsBxc?t=22""&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 2&lt;/strong&gt; / During the scene where the trio break into Gringotts, Ron Weasley effortlessly uses the Imperius Curse on Bogrod, the goblin teller, without hesitation. Bogrod remains under the effects of the Imperius curse until his own demise at the fiery breath of the security dragon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When cast successfully, the Imperius Curse places the victim completely under the caster’s control (unless the victim is strong enough to resist it) and it is one of three Unforgivable Curses that witches and wizards are forbidden to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why does Ron Weasley know this curse?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought he must have originally learned about it during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson about the Unforgivable Curses in the Goblet of Fire. But when I watched the scene again, I found out that &lt;strong&gt;I was wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron actually already knew about the Imperius Curse prior to Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson, and he learned it from his father, Arthur Weasley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/wsl5fS7KGZc""&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / In the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Mad-Eye Moody provides a lesson about the three Unforgivable Curses, and he calls upon Ron to volunteer the name of one of the curses. Out of all three curses, Ron provides the Imperius Curse and says that he learned it from his father, thus showing he was already familiar with the curse.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads us to our next question. When did Ron practice using the spell to be good enough to charm a goblin teller?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Casting a spell in the wizarding world is not as simple as waving a wand and reading the incantation. If that were true, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters wouldn’t be nearly as threatening. As we’ve seen in the films, the ability to successfully perform any spell comes the same way any good skill does – through practice and proper form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M""&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/strong&gt; / The students practice the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) in Charms class, demonstrating that casting magic is not as simple as wand-waving and word-mumbling. Without the proper technique, a spell’s effects can have alternate (disastrous) results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; / Professor Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to mend Harry’s broken arm and fails (further proving that spells are not successful if they are cast by someone who has no idea what they are doing).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q""&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/strong&gt; / Harry trains with Professor Lupin to learn the Patronus Charm, but Harry is not quite able to cast the spell effectively right away. Even Chosen Ones have to practice to &lt;em&gt;git guud&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, &lt;em&gt;“But Harry also&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/F9KyOu_RchU?t=186""&gt;&lt;em&gt;cast the Imperius Curse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;on a goblin and I’m sure he wasn’t running around practicing it on random folks. Maybe it’s just an easier spell to cast?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry has demonstrated (on multiple occasions) a talent for spell mastery due to his unique circumstances. I would argue that part of the reason Harry was able to cast the Imperius Curse so effectively in the Deathly Hallows part 2 without prior training is because he is Voldemort’s Horcrux, and thus, inherits some of the Dark Lord’s abilities (as evidenced through Harry’s ability to speak &lt;a href=""http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue""&gt;parseltongue&lt;/a&gt;). Otherwise, if the curse were really so easy to cast, why wouldn’t anyone just cast it for anything?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that understanding, we have a reasonable guess as to why Harry can cast the curse so easily, but Ron doesn’t have any ties to the Dark Lord or the ability to master spells easily. Ron has, in fact, been historically slower at learning spells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when (or &lt;strong&gt;on whom&lt;/strong&gt;) did Ron practice the curse to become so effective at it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He practiced it on Hermione Granger, which explains why she suddenly fell in love with him. Think about it. Ron was a jerk to Hermione across multiple films and then suddenly she’s all over him, being giddy around him, staying at his house, and calling him brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What?! No. Ron would never do that. He might have picked on Hermione but that’s not exactly evidence that he would do something so evil as to brainwash a friend.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh ho-ho. Strap in, because there is evidence suggesting Ron is actually a lot darker-minded than we realized. But first, let’s talk about motive. Why would Ron even want to mind-control Hermione?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s because he’s jealous of her affection for Harry and is tired of being in Harry’s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Riddikulus!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not a Boggart; that won’t work on me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But Hermione wasn’t attracted to Harry.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are multiple signs that Hermione might have been initially sweet on Harry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/b6eIgrYraEc?t=175""&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Sorcerer’s Stone&lt;/strong&gt; / After Hermione repairs Harry’s glasses, she recognizes him, even though they had never officially met. Harry’s scar is not visible during this scene, so she would not have recognized him via his scar but of photographs of him. Simple moments of infatuation like this are often the foundation of young crushes that lead to romantic interests.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/DfjM5SUkPPg""&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; / Harry is reunited with Hermione in Diagon Alley while shopping for school supplies, where she ends up repairing his glasses once again and does so with a warm smile and bright eyes. This is much different to how she looks at Ron and may be a sign that some of that early infatuation that she had still lingered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/TJIG-KQPnvg""&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; / When Hermione is cured from the Basilisk’s petrification curse, she crashes into Harry with a big, loving hug first and gives him huge smiles.

While this can be attributed to Hermione feeling bad about Harry&amp;#39;s situation, the way she lingers can also be a sign that she likes him and wished him to be there with her.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/R5xJbQL1eHo?t=154""&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;/strong&gt; / During a quidditch match, Harry is attacked by a Dementor and falls unconscious.

When Ron dismisses her offer with a snide remark (such husband material), she turns hopefully to Harry and is elated when he says that he will.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a series of isolated incidents being misinterpreted, either. Even Albus Dumbledore, a powerful wizard with keen intuition and sharp intellect, thought Harry and Hermione might have been together.

If one day, you met a boy who was stupidly famous, obscenely rich, ludicrously successful no matter what he did, and was always the center of everyone’s attention. Then that boy becomes your “best friend”, so that any light of success you have is instantly darkened by his shadow of greatness.

Some of Ron’s older siblings had been on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and it was shown that Ron was hopeful to follow their footsteps.

If you were in Ron’s position, you would definitely notice the blatant favoritism shown to Harry Potter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you’re always in the shadow of your friend’s glory, you start becoming resentful and jealous, which prompts you to do things that make you feel successful (and in control). On a few occasions, Ron sours on Harry for seemingly no rational reason. Other times, Ron purposefully goes out of his way to keep Hermione away from Harry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/an7WWOY94Qs""&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / After it is announced Harry Potter will participate in the incredibly dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, Ron becomes upset with Harry. At one point, Ron even quips, &lt;em&gt;“yeah that’s me, Ron Weasley, Harry’s Potter’s stupid friend,”&lt;/em&gt; which shows that he does actually resent being Harry’s friend, deep down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/tsJ1SmAD55Y?t=65""&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / During the attack on the Quidditch World Cup, Ron is seen dragging Hermione away from Harry even though she is calling out for him.

Ron shows no concern for Harry and is quick to pull Hermione away the minute she asks about Harry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry hasn’t always been the nicest friend to Ron, either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/ktfsgXyRbuc?t=38""&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; / Ron attempts to console a brooding Harry and is harshly pushed away. This occurs just moments after Ron nobly defends Harry to a group of troubled Gryffindor members. This may very well have been the moment where Ron realizes that he is worthless.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the most damning evidence of all, the one that shows us the true thoughts that plague Ron Weasley’s mind, is in the Deathly Hallows when Slytherin’s Locket, one of Voldemort’s seven Horcruxes, reveals his darkest fears and anxieties. It reinforces all of the evidence we just reviewed – that Ron feels inferior to Harry, that he feels that his family doesn’t love him, and that he’ll never have a girl like Hermione because of Harry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/D1XUfFnmflU""&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / When Harry opens Slytherin’s Locket so that Ron can destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor, the locket speaks to Ron with dark whispers from his own heart. When the locket is first opened it says, &lt;em&gt;“I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.”&lt;/em&gt; Among the truths we learn about Ron through the locket are that:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;o Ron’s mother wanted a daughter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;o Ron’s mother once admitted that she would have preferred Harry as a son.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;o The locket’s shadow of Hermione also said, “Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared to the Chosen One?”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, Slytherin’s Locket could be lying in order to cripple Ron Weasley’s spirit. But also keep this in mind… If all the locket’s words were complete lies, Ron would never have been paralyzed by them. The fact is, there was truth in the locket’s words. The locket only whispered whatever dark thoughts were already in Ron’s heart. This confirms that Ron was indeed jealous of Harry, indeed frustrated about not being able to “get the girl”, and insecure about his relationship with his family. All of this, added with the other evidence, means that it is absolutely plausible that Ron may have been driven to desperation at one point, whether he meant to or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a motive, let’s talk about Ron’s proclivity for dark behavior. Even if we might have a plausible motive, surely our sweet Won-Won would never even think about doing something so vile as to mind-control Hermione. Right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But actually, he’s shown us that maybe he’s not the most noble Gryffindor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/vxG6OFjPgXQ""&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / While eating, Nigel Wolpert delivers a parcel to Ron then awkwardly lingers until Ron dismisses him. When Hermione gives Ron a questioning look, he admits that he promised Nigel Harry’s autograph. Ron basically admitted to securing favors (such as servitude) in exchange for celebrity items, which shows a willingness to use his friendship with Harry to his personal benefit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=111""&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / During the scene at the diner where the trio are deciding what to do with the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley is the first one to unflinchingly suggest murder showing that he clearly has a dark side. When Hermione meekly protests, Ron tries to justify his cruelty. Harry has to be the voice of reason by suggesting an alternate, less criminal solution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we have a motive, evidence that Ron had knowledge of the curse to carry out the act, and we have seen evidence of Ron’s darker personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But the Imperius Curse only works on weak-minded wizards. Hermione is definitely not weak. Ron wouldn’t be able to charm someone as strong-willed as her.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sf1dH0Bibyk?t=9""&gt;Right you are, Harry!&lt;/a&gt; The films have demonstrated Hermione to be a strong wizard, amazingly smart and incredibly skilled in a variety of subjects and skillsets. Normally, I would wager that Hermione would be able to resist the Imperius Curse. Except, Hermione is not always strong willed. In fact, when it comes to her friends, we’ve seen her succumb to their requests before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible that, while Hermione would normally be able to resist an Imperius Curse from anyone else, she’s not as strong willed when it comes to her friends. &lt;a href=""https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/""&gt;Stress can also have negative impacts on a person’s mental and emotional willpower&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve seen Hermione go through a lot of emotional distress with her friends throughout the films, from worrying about Harry’s safety to running off crying because of Ron’s cruel comments. The stress Hermione deals with could have also attributed to her not being able to counter the Imperius Curse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Ron took advantage of that fact to &lt;strong&gt;groom&lt;/strong&gt; Hermione and lower her defenses so that he could successfully curse her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://abuse.wikia.com/wiki/Adult_grooming""&gt;Grooming&lt;/a&gt; is a tactic seen in abusive relationships where a person’s normal defenses (or strong wills) are overcome by slowly desensitizing them to abusive behaviors. It often works by mixing positive behaviors with elements of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/v53pXrhfYf0""&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/strong&gt; / While Harry is down by the lake with Neville, Hermione approaches Harry with a message from Ron, who is seen standing just a yard behind her. It is clear that Hermione is not thrilled about being used by Ron to deliver a message to a person he is within speaking distance of, but she does so anyway. After failing the first attempt, Hermione attempts to withdraw from the commitment and urges Ron to deliver the message. Ron pushes back and forces Hermione to follow through. Ron&amp;#39;s choice to force Hermione to carry out such an asinine command can be seen as an attempt by him to assert his authority and will over her. This is considered &lt;a href=""https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/manipulation.html""&gt;manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, which is another form of abuse, where the manipulator (Ron) gets the victim to do something they don’t want to do through a variety of techniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/sk5I27gTOj0?t=137""&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / During the scene at the diner, after Harry makes the decision to wipe the memories of the fallen Death Eater, Antonin Dolohov, Ron Weasley approaches Hermione, caresses her face, then tells her to perform the act of wiping the Death Eater&amp;#39;s memory. This part of a grooming process, where the abuser (Ron) asks their victim (Hermione) to perform various acts that make them feel just as guilty as the abuser. Ron further imposes himself upon Hermione by making physical contact prior to giving a command. Note, that Ron doesn&amp;#39;t ask Hermione to do it. If he truly cared about her, he would realize that wiping someone&amp;#39;s memory might be a sensitive subject considering she just had to wipe her parents&amp;#39; memories. Instead, Ron commands her to do it and Hermione follows through without any protest though it is visibly clear that she is completely uncomfortable with it. This is an example of grooming.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/kVCHnJBioW4""&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / While in search of a way to destroy Slytherin’s Locket, the trio take turns carrying the Horcrux. While Ron carries the locket, he starts being overwhelmed by its darkness. Just being near the locket draws out the darkest fears and anxieties of a person. In this case, it happens to be Ron’s jealousy of Hermione. Ron’s jealousy eventually becomes so unbearable that he fights with Harry and then decides to leave. But before doing so, he stops to ask Hermione if she’s staying or going. This is an example of &lt;a href=""https://abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/basic_coercion.html""&gt;basic coercive&lt;/a&gt; techniques often used by abusers in relationships where the abuser (Ron) tries to maintain his control by forcing the victim to choose between them or something else. It’s like horrific “all or nothing” scenario where the victim, who clearly has feelings for the abuser, is muddled by the sudden pressure to abruptly make a decision that will have major lasting impacts. Typically, the victim in this situation would surrender to the side of the abuser, because the pressure of making that kind of decision in the moment is too great, and it’s hard for anyone to just walk away. But in this case, we see Hermione actually resist. Interesting how she can do that when she’s not under a mind-controlling curse. It’s clear that Ron’s only method of maintaining relationships is through coercion, manipulation, and mind-control, at this point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron just isn’t an insensitive brat, he’s an abusive friend and a manipulator, as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that Hermione is a victim of abuse and a victim of the Imperius Curse becomes even more clear during the Deathly Hallows, when Ron decides to leave out of jealousy. After Ron leaves, Harry and Hermione instantly start connecting, almost as if Hermione changes without Ron’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/GM5WI4MTXzc""&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 1&lt;/strong&gt; / After Ron has left, some time passes, and Harry and Hermione are sitting alone together in their camping tent when they make a sudden connection. As if Hermione is starting to wake up from a nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now we have to determine: When did it all happen? At what point did Ron lose himself and do the unthinkable to Hermione?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering all the evidence, I believe, sometime during the Order of the Phoenix, Ron Weasley used the Imperius Curse on Hermione Granger. This is the time we start seeing Hermione hang around Ron a little more closely but she hasn’t quite started falling over him. That happens during the events of the Half-Blood Prince where Hermione is not only sleeping over at Ron’s house a few days before the start of the school year but she’s also looking at him more and becoming incredibly upset when he runs off with other girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I believe it may have first occurred during the winter break of the school year during Order of the Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/-mJqm_ijE6s?t=25""&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Order of the Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; / Inside the House of Black, the Weasleys celebrate the Christmas holiday with the return of Arthur Weasley (who had been previously attacked) and exchange presents. When Ron opens his present, Hermione smiles warmly at Ron. This is odd because in the previous scene, Hermione is digging at Ron with her usual sharp wit. There is seemingly no reason for her to smile at Ron like that during something as simple as unwrapping a present unless something had happened between them. Maybe they cozied up during the winter break? Or maybe, Ron decided he’d had enough of being the sidekick of the group and used the Imperius Curse on Hermione for the first time. This scene occurs after Harry snaps at Ron, who was only trying to help [39]. Notice, too, in this scene that Hermione does not greet Harry when he arrives. She has typically given Harry big, bright welcomes in the past but here, she only gives him a frowning glance. This could suggest that Ron used the Imperius Curse to also tone-down Hermione’s enthusiasm for Harry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But Hermione doesn’t look like she’s under the influence of the Imperius Curse.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The films have been inconsistent with how the Imperius Curse is represented. For example, in the Goblet of Fire, &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/FyqA7eWrFt8?t=123""&gt;victims of the curse are shown to have milky eyes&lt;/a&gt;. But during Mad-Eye Moody’s lesson on the Unforgiveable Curses [12], the Professor says that many wizards and witches claimed they only followed Lord Voldemort because they were under the influence of the Imperius Curse, and implied it was a challenge to determine which ones were lying about being cursed. This would suggest that the curse does not always manifest itself in a visible way. Additionally, in the Deathly Hallows, when Ron and Harry use the Imperius Curse on the goblins [11], the victim does not adopt any physical characteristics that would imply they are bewitched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on this, we can safely assume that people under the influence of the Imperius Curse are not always going to show obvious signs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But while I believe Ron bewitched Hermione, I don’t believe Hermione was under the influence the entire time. I believe Ron used the curse a few times in short bursts. Just long enough to start grooming Hermione so that she notices him instead of Harry. I also believe that the kiss Ron and Hermione share during the Deathly Hallows part 2 is not because of the Imperius Curse, but is a direct consequence of Hermione being cursed multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re still not convinced, if there’s even a shred of doubt still lingering after considering all of the evidence, then let me leave you with one last thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Deathly Hallows pt. 2, when our beloved trio of friends (now adults with children of their own) watch their children ride towards Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express, look at Ron’s expression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/y1AmEGg6XiE?t=117""&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Hallows pt. 2&lt;/strong&gt; / In the final scene of the entire film series, Harry, Hermione, and Ron walk their children to platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express. We learn that Ron is now a father of three adorable little Weasley-Granger children. Harry and Hermione warmly smile as they watch their children ride off toward their first Hogwarts adventures but Ron shows no emotion. In fact, he looks a little depressed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron. Looks. &lt;strong&gt;Destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;. Hermione is smiling. Harry is smiling. But Ron? Ron looks like he dun goofed. He just stares forward with a vacant expression and eyes devoid of any joy. &lt;del&gt;He looks like a man who had a wild fling with a beautiful girl but then got stuck with three children and realized “oh snap, being a parent is hard! I thought this would be different!”&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;If his love for Hermione was genuine, why wouldn’t he be happier in this scene?

Where did he practice it? The films established that spells require practice and proficiency to use them successfully. [&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/U6zKb4Zte4M""&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMDTDU7lW8""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/8pAMmDcOk0Q""&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how did Ron become so well practiced with such a spell?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the books...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are separate from the film universe. Though the films are based on the books, the films are different; changes were made to the original story. The films aren&amp;#39;t continuing the story of Harry Potter, they are retelling it. Unfortunately, within the film universe&amp;#39;s retelling, there is plenty of evidence there to suggest Ron used the Imperius Curse on Hermione so that she would fall for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Edit - Additional Evidence (Provided by YOU!)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnWickIsMyPatronus""&gt;u/JohnWickIsMyPatronus&lt;/a&gt; writes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I happen to be watching Goblet of Fire right now, and I noticed something that also points to Ron being abusive.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the ball after Harry introduces Ron to the Patels as their dates, and Mcgonagall says that Harry has to do a customary dance at the beginning of the ball, Ron and one of the Patels start off toward the hall. While walking toward the hall, Patel looks back with a bit of disappointment toward Harry and the other Patel. Ron looks along with her, clearly upset with his robes and jealous of Harry&amp;#39;s robes. Right after that, he grabs Patel by the arm and forces her to walk toward the hall while muttering &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the grabbing of the arm and forcing her somewhere that makes it seem like he&amp;#39;s comfort doing so, and maybe has done it before. &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;amp;t=1m55s""&gt;Looking closer at it,  he clearly gives her a push toward the dance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbtoz0bSuI4&amp;amp;t=1m55s""&gt;E1&lt;/a&gt;] This adds supporting evidence to the idea that Ron was becoming increasingly resentful of Harry and also provides additional evidence of Ron&amp;#39;s controlling (almost possessive) behavior toward women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegumdog""&gt;u/bubblegumdog&lt;/a&gt; writes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I always thought the most damning evidence was the final scene in the last film (not including the epilogue) where Hermione comes up to Harry after he breaks the Elder Wand and grabs his hand and just admires him without looking away. Then Ron comes up and she takes his hand as well and then her face completely changes. Shouldn’t she have had the reaction she had with Harry with Ron instead?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One could argue she was proud of Harry at that moment for breaking the wand but it still begs the question: why does Hermione’s face fall when she grabs Ron’s hand?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/9LcT9kisys4?t=120""&gt;E2&lt;/a&gt;] This adds supporting evidence that Hermione is seemingly struggling with her feelings after having been previously cursed. Look closely at Hermione&amp;#39;s expression as she takes Ron&amp;#39;s hand. She looks down, suddenly lost in though, then blankly looks forward. It&amp;#39;s almost as if she&amp;#39;s waking up and realizing that something isn&amp;#39;t right. I don&amp;#39;t believe she is cursed in this scene but it looks like she&amp;#39;s starting to become aware that her feelings for Ron may not be natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count':
